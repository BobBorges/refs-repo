  ABSTRACT = {This paper is part of a larger, ongoing PhD-project carried out at the K.U.Leuven in Belgium. The project investigates the linguistic effect of intensive bilingualism on Italian as a subordinate language for two generations of Italian-Dutch bilinguals who reside in Limburg, the easternmost region of Flanders, Belgium. The study examines language contact phenomena (language variation and language change) and specific speech patterns and the main purpose is to determine whether different types of grammatical phenomena (morphological, syntactic and lexical) in the speech of bilinguals are affected by language contact in the same way. It also seeks to determine whether the identified changes can be explained on the basis of the processes that are recognized in the literature (Muysken 2001; SilvaCorvalán 1994; Van Coetsem 1995) as characteristic of language contact, namely simplification and transfer. Finally, the project verifies in which way these features correlate with social factors. Until now very few studies on ‘migrant Italian’ in Europe have been carried out up, and most of them have focused on language attrition of the first generation. As far as concerns the Italian language in Belgium, most of the studies on second generation Italians in Flanders concern language behaviour, as eg. language shift (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1991) or school problems of children of migrant workers (Jacqmain 1978a; 1978b; 1979). For the second and third generation Italians, which constitute the group we have opted for, the concept of language loss is composite. In fact, the language of these two generations is the result of a series of phenomena that characterize linguistic evolution in emigrant communities and that can be classified under the general denominator of language loss. A first process is the language attrition of the first generation Italians, due to migration and the social distance from the community of native speakers. Furthermore, a large number of first generation Italians did not speak standard Italian when they immigrated to Belgium, they all spoke their own regional variant. The language they developed by talking with other Italians coming from other regions of Italy was a sort of ‘lingua franca’, often called Italiano popolare (Berruto 1983; Lepschy 1983; 1989a; 1989b; 1989c), to which we will return later in this paper. It is this language that was then passed on to the next generations. The second process that determined the language of the next generations is language shift. Studies on language shift among Italians in Flanders showed that Italian is not used anymore, only in family contexts, i.e. in the presence of grandparents or other first generation Italians that most of the time do not speak Dutch (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1991). The informants who collaborated in my fieldwork (cfr. infra) firmly expressed that they would spontaneously start a conversation in Dutch, rather than in Italian. Although they continue to speak it and although they make efforts to maintain it, for instance by planning frequent holidays in Italy, watching news on Italian television channels and buying Italian journals or magazines, more and more second --and obviously third--generation Italians speak mainly Dutch in every day life, even if they live in a community with many Italians. Dutch has clearly become the dominant language and will continue to influence the language of future generations. As a direct consequence of the previous processes, the third process that defines the language of our target group is the so-called incomplete language acquisition (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1986), due to the},
