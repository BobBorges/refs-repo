              come into being, develop over time, and eventually die. Often
              these developments are motivated by interaction with other
              languages, known as language contact. This dissertation contains
              a bundle of articles that report on the various ways that
              languages effect each other and the factors that condition the
              linguistic results in the Surinamese context'.--back cover of
