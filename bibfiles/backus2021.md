## Notes

UB = Usage-Based

1. **Introduction and definitions**

	CS, Borrowing, Interference
	Usage, Knowledge, Unit (form-meaning), Entrenchment
	
2. **Historical overview**

3. **Critical issues and topics**

		UB's explanatory power relates synchronic -- diachronic dimmensions || individual -- social dimensions

		synchronic language use has immediate effects on mental representations

		structures emergent

		no strict division of linguistic knowledge, within or accross languages
		
			form-meaning units: form = lexical, "material" || schema, "patterns"
			
		activation → entrenchment
	
	— Sociolinguistics
	
		langauge as socio-cultural entity

	— Psycholinguistics
	
	— Linguistics: code-switvhing and borrowing
	
	— Linguistics: modularity
	
	— Linguistics: equivalence
	
4. **Current contributions and research**

	— meaning
	
	— Frequency
	
	— Constructional borrowing
	
		"Structural borrowing may be the inevitable by-product of conceptual influence, of myriad cases of calqued expressions with highly specific meanings rather than the direct activation of a fully schematic foreign-origin pattern with highly schematic meaning." (pp. 119)
	
	— ease of activation
	
5. **Main research methods**

6. **Future directions**
