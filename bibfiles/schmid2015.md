## Notes

+++=2
Conventionalization == "the continual process of establishing and readapting
regularities of communicative behaviour among the members of a speech
community, which is achieved by repeated usage activities in usage events
and subject to the exigencies of the entrenchment processes taking place in
the minds of speakers."

Entrenchment == "the continual reorganization of linguistic knowledge in the
minds of speakers, which is driven by repeated usage activities in usage events
and subject to the exigencies of the conventionalization processes taking
place in speech communities."

both phenomena driven by "usage events" (pg 4)

Usualization == "(Blank 2001, Paul 1920: 31–4) contributes to the effect that recur-
rent utterance types become established and are sustained and continually
adapted as agreed-upon means of reaching recurrent communicative goals
in specific contexts and can therefore function as tacit norms."

Diffusion == "(Bailey et al. 1993, Labov 2003, Trudgill 1974a) causes usualized
utterance types to become and remain conventional in specific contexts and
in certain parts of a speech community."

Routinization == "(Haspelmath 1999: 1055, Langacker 1987a: 100) strengthens pat-
terns of associations representing the commonalities of highly similar
recurrent utterance types, e.g. word forms and fixed expressions."

Schematization == "(Abbot-Smith and Tomasello 2006, Langacker 2008: 17)
strengthens patterns of associations representing the commonalities of
variable recurrent utterance types, e.g. semi-filled lexico-grammatical pat-
terns (e.g. that’s Adj, as manifested by that’s right/great/lovely, etc.) and
fully variable grammatical patterns (e.g. Determiner + Noun, or
Auxiliary Verb + Lexical Verb as very rough representations of
the formal specifications of noun phrases and verb phrases respectively)."

"Multilingual speakers are instrumental for contact-induced language change not
only because they tend to engage in multilingual interaction, but also because two
or more languages coexist, compete, and influence each other in the associative
networks of multilingual speakers. These speakers are more likely to produce and
adopt contact-induced changes, because their networks provide more associative
connections and reference points than those of monolingual speakers. A particu-
larly important type of support is paradigmatic support (see Section 15.1.3) based...

...on cross-linguistic similarities and analogies. Consider the classic situation of a
multilingual medieval scholar borrowing or calquing a Latin or French word or
expression while translating into English. Strictly speaking, this is not a case of
co-adaptation in a multilingual encounter, but very much a lonely and individual
cognitive process taking place in the mind of a single speaker. When more and
more scholars borrow more and more similar words in this way, e.g. different
nouns ending in -ment, or -ance, or -(a)(t)ion, their multilingual associative net-
works find it easy to register the underlying analogy (see Section 11.2.3), allowing
them to contribute effortlessly to the usualization of corresponding word-formation
patterns, e.g. V-ment N , in their native language. I will follow up on these effects
of paradigmatic support in Section 8.2.3 in the context of structural borrowing."
