** Notes

"When acquiring their mother tongue, young children have to deduce the basic
features implicitly from the input they receive. Generally spoken, the more
transparent the features of a linguistic system, the easier it is for children to
deduce these features from the input and the higher their learnability (Slobin,
1973, 1985, 1997; MacWhinney & Bates, 1989; MacWhinney, 2005; Peters,
1997). The transparency of a system, and of grammatical features in particular, is
positively influenced by four interrelated factors: morphological analysability
(non-syncretic and non-homophonous morphemes), morphophonetic clarity
(perceptual salience), morphophonological regularity (no allomorphy), and
pattern frequency." 287
