    abstract = { Advances in communication technologies offer new opportunities for the conduct of qualitative research. Among these, Zoom—an innovative videoconferencing platform—has a number of unique features that enhance its potential appeal to qualitative and mixed-methods researchers. Although studies have explored the use of information and communication technologies for conducting research, few have explored both researcher and participant perspectives on the use of web and videoconferencing platforms. Further, data are lacking on the benefits and challenges of using Zoom as a data collection method. In this study, we explore the feasibility and acceptability of using Zoom to collect qualitative interview data within a health research context in order to better understand its suitability for qualitative and mixed-methods researchers. We asked 16 practice nurses who participated in online qualitative interviews about their experiences of using Zoom and concurrently recorded researcher observations. Although several participants experienced technical difficulties, most described their interview experience as highly satisfactory and generally rated Zoom above alternative interviewing mediums such as face-to-face, telephone, and other videoconferencing services, platforms, and products. Findings suggest the viability of Zoom as a tool for collection of qualitative data because of its relative ease of use, cost-effectiveness, data management features, and security options. Further research exploring the utility of Zoom is recommended in order to critically assess and advance innovations in online methods. }

The authors argue that engagement in these literature-based theatrical activities promotes and expedites language entrenchment that usually develops gradually in ‘normal’ conversational contexts, which are usually lacking in cases of severe language endangerment. The paper addresses the theoretical and practical disparity regarding the role of literature in RLS activities (Fishman 1991), which emphasizes spoken language and ‘natural’ intergenerational language transmission. },

At the same time, various hierarchies illustrate that some things are indeed more likely to be borrowed than others. &lt;i&gt;Linguistic Borrowing in Bilingual Contexts&lt;/i&gt; addresses both, by examining claims of no absolute limits and synthesizing various hierarchies.  It observes that all contact phenomena are systematic, and borrowing is no exception. Regarding forms, the determining factors lie in the nature of the morphological systems in contact and how they relate to one another. Two principles are proposed to determine the nature of the systematicity and interaction: the Principle of System Compatibility (PSC), and its corollary, the Principle of System Incompatibility (PSI). Together, these principles provide a consistent  account of the possibilities and limits to borrowing.",

	abstract = {Linked to a series of sociolinguistic differentials (e.g. power, cultural, conversational) materialized in specific linguistic phenomena, this paper analyzes a couple of discourse markers in Nahuatl linguistics; namely, the presence/absence of epenthetic /i/, its metathesis, and the marked use of pronominal prefixes. All these resources indexicalize different discourse genres and types of interaction together with different social positions in ritual and conversational discourse. Epenthetic /i/ has mostly been described as an obligatory segment to maintain the structure of the Nahuatl syllable, which according to existent grammatical descriptions does not allow consonant clusters. Yet as documented by this and few other works this restriction only holds for written discourse. As an overall trend, in actual oral practice the presence or absence of epenthetic /i/ manifests two different types of discourse, ranging from a highly formal (i.e. ritual) to an informal (i.e. extemporaneous) discourse. Metathesis of epenthetic /i/ is also interpreted by speakers as a marked choice towards a Nahuatl de iksaan, 'ancient Nahuatl', especially with the imperative, xi-/ ix-, whereas its deletion is conceived as the unmarked choice indexing more conversational, informal (referential or not) practices. Regarding pronouns, the shiftbetween the first person singular bound morphemes ni- to the second person singular ti-, while addressing a second person singular, mits-, which from an external point of view could be thought as ungrammatical, also indexes different interactional treatments and power differentials, such as those concomitant to generational and gender differences and different types of discourse and interaction. All this is succinctly analyzed in this paper for the first time, theoretically advancing an interpretation that goes beyond quantitative paradigms in sociolinguistics, postulating more than, for example, an audience oriented (Bell 1984) conversational and power approaches to the variable use of language, particularly in the case of Nahuatl.

We review studies investigating cognate and homograph processing in visual word perception and word production, auditory word perception using the visual world paradigm, and cross-language priming, focusing specifically on how differences in proficiency modulate co-activation during lexical access. We further discuss differences in L2 proficiency in relation to immersion and age of L2 acquisition, how differences in L2 proficiency relate to neurocognitive aspects of cognitive control, and how changes in L2 proficiency relative to L1 proficiency may affect lexical processing.},

This exploratory paper takes a data-driven approach to assessing the use of academic vocabulary in Wikipedia articles. Our analysis is based on Coxhead’s Academic Word List, and the data comes from the Westbury Lab Wikipedia Corpus. We employ methods of statistical data analysis to classify Wikipedia articles according to the frequencies of academic words, and apply the same procedure to a comparable set of texts representing another genre, published research articles. The unsupervised classification procedure groups the articles according to academic content regardless of topic, which allows us to measure genre-specific similarities. The findings of the study show that academic words are common in both genres in focus, and more interestingly, if we look at aggregate frequencies of academic words, Wikipedia articles are not markedly different from RAs within the same discipline. This being said, we can observe disciplinary differences in the distribution of academic words in Wikipedia, such that Economics writing contains more academic words than the other two disciplines in focus. Disciplinary differences can likewise be observed in the distribution of individual academic words. },

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present diachronic changes in terms of the conditions of first language acquisition.
Grammars, seen as mental organs, may change between two generations.  A change is initiated when (a population of) learners converge on a grammatical system which differs in at least one parameter value from the system internalized by the speakers of the previous generation.  Learnability issues then connect to both language acquisition and language change, and understanding language changes depends on understanding how children acquire their native language.  Acquisition is a process in which Universal Grammar (UG) interacts with a context-specific set of Primary Linguistic Data (PLD: the linguistic input to the child-learner) and uses these PLD as the source for triggers or cues that map the innate (preexperience) knowledge to a mature grammar.
If a certain phenomenon has survived through many generations, it must have been reflected clearly in the PLD.  Then, if we note that it has changed, something in the language performance of the previous generation must have changed, and thereby paved the way for a new interpretation.  Innovation leading to linguistic variation in the PLD and gradual changes in PLD play a central role in the explanation here: the immediate cause of a grammar change must lie in some alternation in the PLD.  We will look at how the language spoken in a certain community (E-language) may gradually become different from the language that originally served as the triggering experience.  These changes in the E-language also mean changes in the input available to the child-learners of the next generation and a motivation for a different parameter setting has arisen.},

En mettant en évidence certains phénomènes mal reconnus par la tradition grammaticale, l'auteur en montre l'importance typologique et théorique, et en particulier sur deux points. D'abord, la notion de relation prédicative semble plus apte que toute autre (et en particulier, que toute représentation bipartite) à traiter les phénomènes de hiérarchisation des arguments qui jouent un rôle morphosyntaxique capital. Ensuite, on doit poser comme base de toute la grammaire la notion de prédicativité, propriété qui s'applique à l'ensemble des items lexicaux (avec ses trois classes de verbes, noms et locatifs), de sorte que la construction des syntagmes nominaux (et d'une manière générale de tous les syntagmes) doit être décrite en termes d'opérations sur des schémas fondamentalement prédicatifs. A comprehensive linguistic study of classical nahuatl, the literary Aztec language of the 16th and 17th centuries, from a corpus including the Florentine codex and several other texts. The morphological and syntactic data reveal an underlying system of grammatical categories and semantico-syntactic operations which is of major interest both to typology and to a general theory of language. Two points are particularly important. The first is that the notion of predicative relation seems much more appropriate than any other (in particular, any kind of bipartition) to account for the hierarchy of arguments, which plays a prominent role in nahuatl morphosyntax. The second is that predicativity, a property shared by all lexical items (whose 3 classes are verbs, nouns and locatives) must be viewed as the center of the grammar, so that the construction of noun phrases (and more generally of all phrases) should be described in terms of operations applied to basically predicative patterns.},

This book is an introduction to the subject, covering individual and societal multilingualism, the acquisition of two or more languages from birth, second language acquisition in adulthood, language change, linguistic typology, language processing and the structure of the language faculty. It explains the effects of multilingualism on society and language policy, as well as the consequences that long-term bilingualism within communities can have for the structure of languages. Drawing on the author's own first-hand observations of child and adult bilingualism, the book provides a clear analysis of such phenomena as language convergence, grammatical borrowing, and mixed languages.},

Those published to date have largely been from the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Testaments of Toluca presents a large body of Nahuatl wills (98) from 1652 to 1783 from an important valley not much studied, thus greatly enlarging our perspective on the evolution of indigenous society and culture in central Mexico. Each testament is transcribed, translated, and accompanied by a commentary on the testator's situation and on interesting terminology. A substantial introductory study fully analyzes the testamentary genre as seen in this corpus (a first) and summarizes the content of the documents in realms such as gender, kinship, household, and land. Wills are very human documents, and the apparatus draws out this aspect, telling us much about indigenous life in central Mexico in the third century after Spanish contact. All this makes the book of potential interest to a broad spectrum of readers."--BOOK JACKET.  xv, 250 p. : ill. ; 29 cm. Nahuas -- History -- Sources.

A comparative study of two pastoral texts reveals that the differences between the honorific registers of the Nahuatl varieties were quantitative rather than categorical: the structure of honorifics is the same (for all syntactic categories), but significant differences appear in the frequency of honorific marking, especially on verbs. Metalinguistic comments in Spanish sources provide evidence of the impact of these differences on stylistic marking, ethnic boundary work, and indexing of social status.},

	abstract = {This article examines the practice of ordaining young men because of their personal language ability, a process referred to as an ordination a título de lengua. As a result of reforms codified by the Catholic Church in the Council of Trent, prospective priests were required to support themselves without assistance from the Church, a requirement called a title. This requirement was satisfied if an ordinand enjoyed a benefice or a chantry. Because of the need to have as many priests who knew native languages as possible, the crown ordered that the ability to speak a native language could be used in lieu of a title. Starting in the 1560s the bishops of Mexico began to keep track of clergy according to their ability to speak a native language. When the system of oposiciones (competitive placement exams) began in the 1580s, candidates for benefices would be tested on their language ability. This article traces the development of a bilingual secular clergy in order to evaluate whether royal officials responded to the widespread use of Nahuatl at the time of contact or whether those same officials encouraged the spread of Nahuatl through their policies.},

    abstract = { The concept of disease causation has changed twice, first from natural to social determining factors, and, second, from determination by social conditions to determination by stressful social relations. These changes roughly parallel the emergence of industrial capital and its change from a highly individualistic and competitive process to a “social” process. In this article, “epidemics” are treated as social events that occur amidst these changes in disease and the economic organization of society.Nineteenth-century epidemics occurred when business attempted to solve its economic problems by creating dramatic gaps between the social needs of an expanding labor force and available goods and services. The coincidence of periodic crises in production and in health ensured that “epidemics” would be occasions for labor to struggle against injustice, not simply sickness. And workers demonstrated a capacity for self-organization during epidemics that forced municipal authorities to reform fundamentally their organization of work, the market, and social service.After 1900, “reform” was a permanent part of capital's developmental strategy. The new “social” capitalist sought to organize work politically, far beyond the factory, and to extract “value” not from blue-collar workers alone but from all social activity.These developments reduced mortality due to infectious and childhood disease. But they also created the new epidemics of chronic stress. Despite the mystification of social etiology by medicine, the identity of the disease process with more general means of social reproduction indicates that illness is now “endopolic,” the product not of nature but of historically specific political and economic decisions and processes. }
