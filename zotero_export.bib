This state-of-the-art Handbook examines the reasons behind this dramatic loss of linguistic diversity, why it matters, and what can be done to document and support endangered languages. The volume is relevant not only to researchers in language endangerment, language shift and language death, but to anyone interested in the languages and cultures of the world. It is accessible both to specialists and non-specialists: researchers will find cutting-edge contributions from acknowledged experts in their fields, while students, activists and other interested readers will find a wealth of readable yet thorough and up-to-date information"--},

I denne artikel præsenterer jeg to tilfælde, hvor sprog ikke passer ind i lingvisters model. I det første tilfælde optræder et hyppigt forekommende morfem tre helt forskellige steder i sproget og behandles derfor også tre forskellige steder i beskrivelsen af sproget. Det andet drejer sig om et sæt personpræfikser, som i mayasprog traditionelt beskrives to forskellige steder og med to forskellige sæt funktioner, mens et forsøg på at identificere en fælles betydning for de adskilte forekomster ville fange deres grundlæggende funktion mere hensigtsmæssigt, men det ville bryde med den traditionelle syntaktiske analyse af sproget. Min konklusion er at forstyrrende særheder i enkelte sprog burde tages mere alvorligt af typologer.},

However, few book-length studies relate attitudes to language policies, or address the changing attitudes of non-speakers and the motivations of members of language movements. Through a combination of ethnographic research and quantitative surveys, this book presents an in-depth study of revitalisation efforts for indigenous languages in three small islands round the British Isles. The author identifies and confronts key issues commonly faced by practitioners and researchers working in small language communities with little institutional support. This book explores the complex relationship of ideologies, identity and language-related beliefs and practices, and examines the implications of these factors for language revitalisation measures. Essential reading for researchers interested in language endangerment and revitalisation, sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology and language policy and planning, as well as language planners and campaigners"--},

	abstract = {Etude linguistique approfondie du nahuatl classique, où aztèque littéraire du XVIe et XVIIe siècles, à partir d'un corpus comprenant le codex de Florence et divers autres textes. En mettant en évidence certains phénomènes mal reconnus par la tradition grammaticale, l'auteur en montre l'importance typologique et théorique, et en particulier sur deux points. D'abord, la notion de relation prédicative semble plus apte que toute autre (et en particulier, que toute représentation bipartite) à traiter les phénomènes de hiérarchisation des arguments qui jouent un rôle morphosyntaxique capital. Ensuite, on doit poser comme base de toute la grammaire la notion de prédicativité, propriété qui s'applique à l'ensemble des items lexicaux (avec ses trois classes de verbes, noms et locatifs), de sorte que la construction des syntagmes nominaux (et d'une manière générale de tous les syntagmes) doit être décrite en termes d'opérations sur des schémas fondamentalement prédicatifs. A comprehensive linguistic study of classical nahuatl, the literary Aztec language of the 16th and 17th centuries, from a corpus including the Florentine codex and several other texts. The morphological and syntactic data reveal an underlying system of grammatical categories and semantico-syntactic operations which is of major interest both to typology and to a general theory of language. Two points are particularly important. The first is that the notion of predicative relation seems much more appropriate than any other (in particular, any kind of bipartition) to account for the hierarchy of arguments, which plays a prominent role in nahuatl morphosyntax. The second is that predicativity, a property shared by all lexical items (whose 3 classes are verbs, nouns and locatives) must be viewed as the center of the grammar, so that the construction of noun phrases (and more generally of all phrases) should be described in terms of operations applied to basically predicative patterns.},

Why some people maintain an ancestral language and transmit it to their children, while others abandon it, is a major issue in the study of language endangerment. This study focuses on Guernesiais, the endangered indigenous language of Guernsey, Channel Islands. Baseline data were collected using a questionnaire and semistructured interviews; ethnographic methods then shed light on ideologies, attitudes, and the processes of language shift. Availability of interlocutors correlates strongly with fluency, for both native speakers and learners, but the increasing age and linguistic isolation of many native speakers contributes to both individual and societal language loss, along with other factors. Options for supporting (or reconstituting) social networks through language planning are examined.},

However, since colonial texts were often written by bilingual natives or Spanish friars, they include both Nahua and Spanish ways of associating meanings. This paper examines the use of several Nahuatl terms for children and grandchildren in speeches and dialogues recorded in colonial written sources. Taking into account both their morphology and contextual occurrences, it suggests that they formed a system, in which particular terms and grammatical forms marked the tone of speech, the amount of reverence and the social distance. It also attempts at separating pre-Hispanic terminology from Nahuatl honorifics used by preachers, illustrating the difference between the two metaphorical systems.},

In this article we broaden the evidentiary base, analyzing a corpus of forty-six Nahuatl documents spanning the years 1549–1666 from Central America. Most of these documents date from the turn of the sixteenth century and are in the Central American Nahuatl dialect of Pipil. Some exhibit incorrect emulations of the Classical Nahuatl of central Mexico, brought to the region by the Spaniards' Nahua allies. Those written in Classical Nahuatl were generally produced in areas of significant Nahua and/or Spanish colonization. We conclude that Nahuatl in colonial Central America was significantly impacted by indigenous Pipil. As a vehicular language, Pipil was as useful as the central Mexican Nahuatl of the invaders, and it developed its own written standard. In general, Nahuatl of all kinds served as a vehicular language in colonial Central America for only about a century after conquest and followed the path of the invaders.},

	abstract = {Linked to a series of sociolinguistic differentials (e.g. power, cultural, conversational) materialized in specific linguistic phenomena, this paper analyzes a couple of discourse markers in Nahuatl linguistics; namely, the presence/absence of epenthetic /i/, its metathesis, and the marked use of pronominal prefixes. All these resources indexicalize different discourse genres and types of interaction together with different social positions in ritual and conversational discourse. Epenthetic /i/ has mostly been described as an obligatory segment to maintain the structure of the Nahuatl syllable, which according to existent grammatical descriptions does not allow consonant clusters. Yet as documented by this and few other works this restriction only holds for written discourse. As an overall trend, in actual oral practice the presence or absence of epenthetic /i/ manifests two different types of discourse, ranging from a highly formal (i.e. ritual) to an informal (i.e. extemporaneous) discourse. Metathesis of epenthetic /i/ is also interpreted by speakers as a marked choice towards a Nahuatl de iksaan, 'ancient Nahuatl', especially with the imperative, xi-/ ix-, whereas its deletion is conceived as the unmarked choice indexing more conversational, informal (referential or not) practices. Regarding pronouns, the shiftbetween the first person singular bound morphemes ni- to the second person singular ti-, while addressing a second person singular, mits-, which from an external point of view could be thought as ungrammatical, also indexes different interactional treatments and power differentials, such as those concomitant to generational and gender differences and different types of discourse and interaction. All this is succinctly analyzed in this paper for the first time, theoretically advancing an interpretation that goes beyond quantitative paradigms in sociolinguistics, postulating more than, for example, an audience oriented (Bell 1984) conversational and power approaches to the variable use of language, particularly in the case of Nahuatl.

	abstract = {This article examines the practice of ordaining young men because of their personal language ability, a process referred to as an ordination a título de lengua. As a result of reforms codified by the Catholic Church in the Council of Trent, prospective priests were required to support themselves without assistance from the Church, a requirement called a title. This requirement was satisfied if an ordinand enjoyed a benefice or a chantry. Because of the need to have as many priests who knew native languages as possible, the crown ordered that the ability to speak a native language could be used in lieu of a title. Starting in the 1560s the bishops of Mexico began to keep track of clergy according to their ability to speak a native language. When the system of oposiciones (competitive placement exams) began in the 1580s, candidates for benefices would be tested on their language ability. This article traces the development of a bilingual secular clergy in order to evaluate whether royal officials responded to the widespread use of Nahuatl at the time of contact or whether those same officials encouraged the spread of Nahuatl through their policies.},

Metalinguistic comments in Spanish sources provide evidence of the impact of these differences on stylistic marking, ethnic boundary work, and indexing of social status.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This article presents data showing that the syntax of the Nahuatl dialect spoken in Hueyapan, Morelos, Mexico has traits of nonconfigurationality: free word order and free pro-drop, with predicate-initial word order being pragmatically neutral. It permits discontinuous noun phrases and has no naturally occurring true quantifiers, suggesting that noun phrases in Hueyapan Nahuatl are adjuncts rather than actual arguments. These findings are contrasted with those of an earlier study by Jeffrey MacSwan, who concludes that Nahuatl syntax has relatively fixed subject-verb-object word order. It is suggested that the differences observed between the two Nahuatl varieties may be a result of methodological problems in MacSwan's collection of data, skewing it in the direction of a more rigid syntax.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Parmi les « quarante magiciens du monde nahuatl » identifiés par López Austin (1967), l’un des personnages les moins connus est sans doute le tlahuipuchtli, terme qui aujourd’hui se trouve associé à des sorcières suceuses de sang. L’intention principale de cet article sera donc de définir la signification et la fonction sociale de la croyance à ce type d’être surnaturel. Étant donné que ce personnage est très vaguement décrit dans les sources anciennes, il faudra rechercher ce qu’en disent les données ethnographiques contemporaines pour le définir et en expliquer le sens. Nous passerons d’abord en revue les informations anciennes, pour ensuite élaborer le stéréotype du tlahuipuchtli contemporain et montrer de quelle façon l’image de la sorcière espagnole intervient dans la construction de l’imaginaire du tlahuipuchtli. Finalement, on tentera d’expliquer son symbolisme et de déterminer si la croyance en des sorciers suceurs de sang existait à l’époque préhispanique.},

Here the Nahuatl language has experienced a revival within the last five years, to a degree where congregational meetings are now held mostly in Nahuatl, and where young Witnesses are probably the only group of youths in Hueyapan to communicate daily in Nahuatl. It is argued that this situation arose as a result of the combination of the general sociolinguistic background in Hueyapan and the specific value system and social dynamics that exist in the community of Jehovah's Witnesses.},

The studies address questions of what constituted male identity, and male sexuality. How was masculinity constructed in different social groups? How did the secular and ecclesiastical ideals of masculinity reinforce each other or diverge? These essays address the topic of medieval men and, through a variety of theoretical, methodological, and disciplinary approaches, significantly extend our understanding of how, in the Middle Ages, masculinity and identity were conflicted and multifarious.},

The introduction describes the setup of the questionnaire and the methodology of the approach, along with a survey of the difficulties of sampling in contact linguistics.

Having repercussions for many areas of syntax and related aspects of morphology and semantics, this argument results in a comprehensive picture of the grammar of polysynthetic languages.

Weber examines the social monad through interviews conducted with children of Vietnam Veterans and social artifacts of the Vietnam War, including Oliver Stone's films on the Vietnam War (Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, and Heaven and Earth), autobiographies of Vietnam Veterans, and media images of the Vietnam Veteran in current society.},

We then use this methodological approach to frame a discussion of data concerning eight innovations that can be attributed to transfer from the majority language (English) to the French of Francophones residing in the province of Ontario in Canada. This discussion shows, notably, how systemic and extra-systemic factors play a role in the emergence of these innovations. We also demonstrate that there are interesting differences in the extent to which these innovations are used across speaker groups and communities, and we argue that such differences suggest that there are thresholds of language contact associated with the emergence, or lack thereof, of particular transfer-induced innovations.},

In this paper we review empirical studies that have examined how differences in L2 proficiency modulate cross-language co-activation and interaction during bilingual lexical processing. We review studies investigating cognate and homograph processing in visual word perception and word production, auditory word perception using the visual world paradigm, and cross-language priming, focusing specifically on how differences in proficiency modulate co-activation during lexical access. We further discuss differences in L2 proficiency in relation to immersion and age of L2 acquisition, how differences in L2 proficiency relate to neurocognitive aspects of cognitive control, and how changes in L2 proficiency relative to L1 proficiency may affect lexical processing.},

Though such an ideology is true of many groups and many individuals, it is not true of all groups: some, such as Jews, Greeks, Armenians, overseas Indians, Chinese, etc., define their identity in other ways, according to religion, tradition, and/or ancestry, but not native language. An ideology defining identity in terms of native language will inevitably view groups rejecting this ideology as being deficient, low on the ‘authenticity hierarchy’ established by this ideology, deceptively speaking ‘other peoples' ’ languages, and perversely and insistently claiming distinctive identities and interests. It is just such an understanding of the alleged ‘natural’ connection between language and identity which was at the heart of the development of Nazi antisemitism, the view that Jews were impure, deceptive, and not normal human beings.},

The authors examine the train of interconnected political and military events, and set military operations against the background of Hitler's war policy and general aims, both immediate and long term. Their comprehensive analysis, based on detailed scholarly research, is underpinned by a full apparatus of maps, diagrams, and tables. The conflict took a course quite different from that which Hitler had intended, but nevertheless resulted in a series of conquests for the Third Reich. At the same time, the establishment of hegemony on the European continent confronted the aggressor with new problems.Intensively researched and documented, Germany and the Second World War is an undertaking of unparalleled scope and authority.

The authors examine the systematic preparation for war, from the outset of Nazi rule, through rearmament, economic autarky, diplomacy, and the penetration of German society at all levels. They consider the extent to which the movement can be regarded as a continuation of historic German nationalism; the limits of Hitler's involvement with the army and big business; and the lack of coordination between the administration and the armed services. The book demonstrates that, despite Nazi propaganda and in stark contrast to 1914, most Germans in 1939 opposed a war which they nevertheless endured with such tragic consequences.Intensively researched and documented, Germany and the Second World War is an undertaking of unparalleled scope and authority. It will prove indispensable to all historians of the twentieth century.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we bring to the attention of the linguistic community recent research on heritage languages. Shifting linguistic attention from the model of a monolingual speaker to the model of a multilingual speaker is important for the advancement of our understanding of the language faculty. Native speaker competence is typically the result of normal first language acquisition in an environment where the native language is dominant in various contexts, and learners have extensive and continuous exposure to it and opportunities to use it. Heritage speakers present a different case: they are bilingual speakers of an ethnic or immigrant minority language, whose first language often does not reach native-like attainment in adulthood. We propose a set of connections between heritage language studies and theory construction, underscoring the potential that this population offers for linguistic research. We examine several important grammatical phenomena from the standpoint of their representation in heritage languages, including case, aspect, and other interface phenomena. We discuss how the questions raised by data from heritage speakers could fruitfully shed light on current debates about how language works and how it is acquired under different conditions. We end with a consideration of the potential competing factors that shape a heritage language system in adulthood.},

However, the exchange of experimental material has not taken advantage of this progress yet. In order to facilitate access to experimental material, the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) project was created as a free standardized set of visual stimuli accessible to all researchers, through a normative database. The BOSS is currently the largest existing photo bank providing norms for more than 15 dimensions (e.g. familiarity, visual complexity, manipulability, etc.), making the BOSS an extremely useful research tool and a mean to homogenize scientific data worldwide. The first phase of the BOSS was completed in 2010, and contained 538 normative photos. The second phase of the BOSS project presented in this article, builds on the previous phase by adding 930 new normative photo stimuli. New categories of concepts were introduced, including animals, building infrastructures, body parts, and vehicles and the number of photos in other categories was increased. All new photos of the BOSS were normalized relative to their name, familiarity, visual complexity, object agreement, viewpoint agreement, and manipulability. The availability of these norms is a precious asset that should be considered for characterizing the stimuli as a function of the requirements of research and for controlling for potential confounding effects.},

	abstract = {The goal of the present investigation was to identify the reading processes that are impaired in children whose digit naming speeds are slow. Continuous digit naming speed was assumed to measure the automaticity with which character codes may be accessed in memory, and the automaticity of this process was assumed to be a prerequisite for the accurate performance of higher level reading processes. In Study I it was found, for children in grades 1 through 3, that digit naming speed was reliably correlated with reading of both irregularly spelled words and pronounceable nonsense words, and that most of the variance shared by irregular-word and nonsense-word reading was accounted for by digit naming speed. These results were interpreted as evidence that character-identification automaticity is equally important to the direct-access and speech-recoding routes of word recognition. Models of how character-identification automaticity might affect each of these routes are discussed. In Study 2 it was found, for children in grades 4 through 10, that the correlation of digit naming speed with reading comprehension was significantly smaller than its correlation with word recognition, and that the former correlation was completely accounted for when either WISC-R verbal IQ or word-recognition accuracy was controlled. These results are contrasted with comparable results reported by other investigators, and methodological differences are noted.},

	abstract = {Reading predictors evolve through age: phonological awareness is the best predictor of reading abilities at the beginning of reading acquisition while Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) becomes the best reading predictor in more experienced readers (around 9–10 years old). Those developmental changes in the relationship between RAN and reading have so far been explained in term of participants' age. However, it should be noted that in the previous experiments age always co-vary with participants reading level. It is thus not clear whether RAN-reading relationship is developmental in nature or related to the reading system itself. This study investigates whether the behavioral changes in the relationship between RAN and reading and their electrophysiological correlates are related to the chronological age or to the reading level of the participants. Thirty two French-speaking children aged 7–10 years took part to the experiment: they were divided into groups contrasted on age but with similar reading levels and the other way round. Participants performed two reading tasks and four RAN tasks. EEG/ERP was recorded during discrete letter and picture RAN. Behavioral results revealed that alphanumeric RAN is more sensitive to age variations than reading level differences. The inverse profile was revealed for picture RAN, which discriminate poor and good readers among typically developed children within the same age-group. ERPs of both letter and picture RAN differed across age groups whereas only for the picture RAN ERPs differed across reading levels. Taken together, these results suggest that picture RAN is a particularly good indicator of reading level variance independently of age.},

After reading instruction has started, RAN continues to exert an influence on the development of reading fluency over the next 2 years. However, there is no evidence of a reciprocal influence of reading fluency on the growth of RAN skill. We suggest that RAN taps the integrity of left-hemisphere object-recognition and naming circuits that are recruited to function as a critical component of the child's developing visual word-recognition system.},

Prior research indicates that individuals increase cognitive control in order to achieve a desired goal. In the adaptive control hypothesis we propose a stronger hypothesis: Language control processes themselves adapt to the recurrent demands placed on them by the interactional context. Adapting a control process means changing a parameter or parameters about the way it works (its neural capacity or efficiency) or the way it works in concert, or in cascade, with other control processes (e.g., its connectedness). We distinguish eight control processes (goal maintenance, conflict monitoring, interference suppression, salient cue detection, selective response inhibition, task disengagement, task engagement, opportunistic planning). We consider the demands on these processes imposed by three interactional contexts (single language, dual language, and dense code-switching). We predict adaptive changes in the neural regions and circuits associated with specific control processes. A dual-language context, for example, is predicted to lead to the adaptation of a circuit mediating a cascade of control processes that circumvents a control dilemma. Effective test of the adaptive control hypothesis requires behavioural and neuroimaging work that assesses language control in a range of tasks within the same individual.},

The aim of the present study is to provide French normative data for a new set of 299 black-and-white drawings. Alario and Ferrand (1999) were closely followed in that the pictures were standardized on six variables: name agreement, image agreement, conceptual familiarity, visual complexity, image variability, and age of acquisition. Objective frequency measures are also provided for the most common names associated with the pictures. Comparative analyses between our results and the norms obtained in other, similar studies are reported. Finally, naming latencies corresponding to the set of pictures were also collected from French native speakers, and correlational/multiple-regression analyses were performed on naming latencies. This new set of standardized pictures is available on the Internet (http://leadserv.u-bourgogne.fr/bases/pictures/) and should be of great use to researchers when they select pictorial stimuli.},

Les chercheurs qui travaillent sur les langues de communautés minoritaires, comme l’irlandais, le basque, le gallois, le corse, etc., et les processus de changement linguistique et de revitalisation qui leur sont associés, ont dans l’ensemble eu tendance à privilégier l’étude des communautés «natives » . Une attention bien moindre a été portée au locuteur «non natif » , ou à celui que nous appelons ici «néolocuteur » . Nous examinons les raisons de cette situation, et en quoi le traitement du «natif » dans ce sous-champ disciplinaire correspond aux débats épistémologiques plus larges autour du concept de «locuteur natif » en linguistique appliquée et dans les sciences du langage en général.},

Such policies, however, can have unforeseen consequences and lead to tensions between newcomers and existing speakers over questions of ownership, legitimacy, and authenticity. This article examines these tensions in the case of Galician in northwestern Spain, where “new speakers” have emerged in the context of revitalization policies since the 1980s. The subsequent spread of the language outside traditional Galician strongholds and into what were predominantly Spanish spaces complicates the traditional ideology about sociolinguistic authenticity and ownership and raises questions about who are the legitimate speakers of Galician, who has authority, and the potential tensions that such questions generate. To illustrate the tensions and paradoxes that new and native speakers face in this postrevitalization context, we draw on three discussion groups consisting of sixteen young Galicians.

Our speakers learned Gaelic as adults and are now highly advanced users of the language. We consider variation in their rhotic productions compared to the productions of six older, traditional speakers. Previous approaches to variation in second language users have either focussed on how variable production will eventually result in native-like ‘target’ forms (Type 1 study), or have investigated the extent to which second language users reproduce patterns of variation similar to ‘native speakers’ (Type 2 study). We additionally draw on sociocultural approaches to Second Language Acquisition and apply notions of accent aim, identity construction, and learning motivation in order to fully explore the data. In doing so, we advocate a ‘Type 3’ approach to variation in second language users.},

There is growing recognition that multiple mechanisms underlie the range of profiles observed in these children. Broadly speaking, both the domain-general executive attentional system known as working memory and domain-specific linguistic processing have been implicated in children with SLI. It has been challenging to tease apart these influences, however, due to the symbiotic relationship between working memory and language learning. For example, working memory limits might constrain the linguistic detail encoded, whereas poor language knowledge would place greater demands on working memory for retaining unfamiliar phonological information. There is growing evidence for separable impairments in these processing resources leading to relative deficits in linguistic or working memory processes in different children. Such findings have important clinical implications for both the assessment and treatment of children with SLCN.},

	abstract = {In this review, the origins and history of a test of rapid automatized naming (RAN) are traced from nineteenth-century classical brain-behavior analyses of cases of acquired “alexia without agraphia” through adaptations to studies of normal and reading disabled children. The element of speed (of responding verbally to a visual stimulus) was derived from a test of color naming developed over 50 years ago as a bedside measure of recovery from brain injuries. Merging the “visual-verbal” connection essential to reading (specific) with the response time element (general), RAN turned out to be a useful correlate and predictor of reading competence, accounting even for variance beyond that accounted for by timed tests of discrete naming. As one of the two deficits highlighted in the Double Deficit hypothesis with phonological awareness, RAN has emerged as something more than a particularly difficult challenge to a unitary phonological retrieval deficit, and has itself been subjected to further dissection. Coming full circle to its origins, recent research suggests that RAN taps both visual-verbal (language domain) and processing speed (executive domain) contributions to reading.},

	abstract = {"In recent decades the 'death' of minority languages has attracted the attention of journalists, scholars and the general public and now features in various discourses about the decline of ecological and cultural diversity due to globalization. Many minority languages are undergoing revitalization (mainly through educational initiatives) and, as a result, some of these languages can demonstrate a slowing down in the rate of decline in the number of speakers. This has led to the appearance, in many instances, of so-called 'new' speakers, that is speakers who have acquired a minority language outside the traditional conduits of family and/or community. This book examines the background to this phenomenon and demonstrates how new speakers have appeared among Breton, Yiddish and Lemko speakers, all of whom demonstrate similar struggles and successes in their attempts to use their adopted languages in a meaningful way."--},

Results support previous work suggesting that new speakers will sound different from ‘traditional speakers’. These results are discussed in terms of language contact, modes of acquisition in revitalisation situations, and the differing perceptions and ideologies surrounding how new speakers use Gaelic. The data also necessitate an examination of some of the assumptions in sociolinguistic models of change and their applicability to contexts of rapid social evolution.

My aims are, first, to introduce and defend mentalist views of communication in general; second, to defend one such view, namely that communication is a cognitive competence, that is, a faculty, and the underlying idea that the architecture of the mind/brain is domain-specific; and, third, to review the (scarce) neuropsychological evidence that bears on these issues.},

	abstract = {The traditional view in pragmatic theory is that a distinction exists between what speakers say and what they mean, communicate, or implicate in context. For example, when uttering Jane has three children, a speaker might only say that “Jane has three children but may have more than three,” but the speaker implicates that “Jane has exactly three children.” Under this view, pragmatics plays only a small role in determining what speakers say and has a primary part in interpreting speaker's intended messages. My aim in this article is to challenge this view. I describe empirical work showing that pragmatics has a fundamental role in determining both what speakers say and implicate. Thus, when a speaker utters Jane has three children, enriched pragmatic information is used to infer that the speaker says “Jane has exactly three children” and that in specific contexts, the speaker can go on to express additional pragmatic meanings, such as “Jane is married” or “Jane is very busy because she has three children.” I also describe work on the importance of complex pragmatic, metarepresentational reasoning in understanding irony and metaphor. Finally, I briefly discuss the relevance of these new developments in pragmatics for neurolinguistic research.},

Evidence from normal speakers provides only partial support for both theories. Evidence from brain-injured populations suggests that aspects of the pragmatic process can be arrested in ways not predicted by either theory. It is concluded that sarcasm is more effortful to process than nonsarcastic comments and that inferences about the facts of the situation and the mental state of the speaker (e.g., attitudes, knowledge, and intentions) are important to comprehending sarcasm. It is questioned whether inferences about mental state are relatively more difficult for brain-injured subjects and, if so, whether this is a continuum of difficulty or reflects reliance upon different cognitive processes.},

An analysis of the various modes and modalities of multilingualism in a health clinic in the city of Barcelona reveals the ideologies behind the practices and it shows how the reproduction of a particular social and institutional order is accomplished in everyday routine interactions that take place. Following Giddens (1984) on the role of agency it is possible to observe how institutional measures to incorporate multilingualism produce unintended consequences for migrants who come into contact with the health system. Language and communication appear at the center of the tensions and conflicts that arise between social actors within the institution. Ethnographic fieldwork and various types of data show the contradictions of institutional thinking and agency as well as the outcomes.},

Despite lower scores in language ability in the target language, multilingual and bilectal children performed at rates comparable to the monolinguals with implicature. Regression analyses indicated a positive correlation between implicature, language proficiency, and age (but not executive control), albeit language ability did not affect implicature within multilinguals. We suggest an interpretation according to which multilingual, bilectal, and monolingual children maintain a comparable level of implicature understanding, but they do so by relying on different resources. Finally, a principal component analysis on different implicature types revealed a single factor of implicature performance. This outcome has implications for pragmatic theory.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to discuss how the emerging new language with its own developing socio-cultural foundation affects the existing L1-governed knowledge and pragmatic competence of adult sequential bilinguals. It is assumed that these bilinguals already have an L1-governed pragmatic competence at place, which will be adjusted to accommodate the socio-cultural requirements of the new language. So there is no separate L2 pragmatic competence. What happens is that the existing L1-governed pragmatic competence becomes bilingual pragmatic competence while changing dynamically under the influence of the new language and its socio-cultural requirements and behaviour patterns blending the emerging features and skills with the existing ones. I will argue that there is a basic difference between the development of pragmatic competence in L1 and the sequential development of bilingual pragmatic competence. While the former is controlled mainly by the socio-cultural environment the latter is mostly motivated by individual will and preference. In the L1 language development and social development go hand in hand as a mostly subconscious, automatic and instinctive process in which individual consciousness and willingness to acquire social skills and knowledge play a relatively limited role. The whole process depends mainly on exposure to and nature of socio-cultural environment. Bilingual pragmatic competence, however, develops differently. When the new language is added gradually the existing L1-governed pragmatic competence is affected (besides exposure to L2 and environment) and motivated by individual control, consciousness and willingness to modify existing skills and behaviour patterns and acquire particular social skills and ignore others. This is not to say that the socio-cultural exposure and environment is not important. It of course is. However, it appears that there is more individual control included in bilingual pragmatic development than is the case in L1 pragmatic development.},

Moving away from the traditional intuitive approach to linguistics, which used made-up examples, corpus linguistics has made a significant contribution to all areas of the field. Until very recently, corpus linguistics has focused almost exclusively on syntax and the lexicon; however corpus-based approaches to the other subfields of linguistics are now rapidly emerging, and this is the first handbook on corpus pragmatics as a field. Bringing together a team of leading scholars from around the world, this handbook looks at how the use of corpus data has informed research into different key aspects of pragmatics, including pragmatic principles, pragmatic markers, evaluation, reference, speech acts, and conversational organisation"--},

The phenomenon of language is not necessarily a construction, and while all individual languages are constructed, it is not possible to clearly delimit them from each other. The crucial phenomenon is language, not any specific language. While some Some speakers think languages should be kept apart, others combine three, four, or more different sets of features (i.e. so-called ‘languages’) in their linguistic production. This is characteristic of polylingualism (where multilingualism is characterised by the knowledge of several separate languages). These speakers do not choose their features randomly.

As well as linguistic perspectives, the handbook includes insights from anthropology, social psychology, the study of discourse and power, conversation analysis, theories of style and styling, language contact and applied sociolinguistics. Language practices seem to have reached new levels since the communications revolution of the late twentieth century. At the same time face-to-face communication is still the main force of language identity, even if social and peer networks of the traditional face-to-face nature are facing stiff competition of the Facebook-to-Facebook sort. The most authoritative guide to the state of the field, this handbook shows that sociolinguistics provides us with the best tools for understanding our unfolding evolution as social beings."--Publisher's website},

	abstract = {Conversation Analysis has come to be the dominant approach to the systematic study of social interaction. Mixed methods studies combining CA with quantitative methods have been utilized since the 1980s to test associations between interaction practices and sociodemographic variables, attitudinal variables, outcomes, and even factors such as the economy. However, any sort of formal coding risks a massive reduction and flattening of complex human behavior to simplistic codes. Thus, a question arises as to whether it is possible to make use of formal coding in a way that remains true to CA principles about the study of social interaction. In this article, I argue that the formal coding of interaction behavior is not necessarily antithetical to conversation analysis. Although formal coding of interaction is frequently a top-down process that is not grounded in CA, interaction coding can be done in ways that do not sacrifice a CA sensibility and that are true to CA principles. In this article I discuss the aspects of CA methods that form a natural basis for formal coding and then go on to contrast non-CA-grounded formal coding with CA-grounded formal coding. Finally, I review some of the limitations of mixed methods CA formal coding studies of interaction. Data are in American and British English.},

Using conversation analysis (CA) of a single interaction between a client and a beauty therapist, we show how task-directed talk, and even aspects of the physical work itself, may be designed to perform a dual function: to complete, satisfactorily, the procedure for which the client is paying, and to perform some of those actions that researchers have dubbed `emotional labour'. In our data, the therapist gives precedence to performing the emotional labour over the immediate accomplishment of the institutionally defined goal (hair removal), thereby providing concrete, recorded evidence for the claim that emotional labour is a job requirement for beauty therapy.},

However, relatively little attention has been given to the way older-age categorial terms and expressions are used in everyday, non-medicalised settings and the kinds of identities thereby achieved. In this study I aim to bring to the fore and explain the variability of stances towards older-age terms and expressions in an ordinary setting, a hair-salon. I explore this variability by scrutinizing in detail cases where older women resist another's use of aging to explain their ailment or complaint, and contrast these with cases where the same women, in the same appointment, themselves invoke older age to explain or intensify their own problem. Drawing on audio-recorded conversations between clients and salon-workers and using the micro-discourse analytic tools of Conversation Analysis and Membership Categorization Analysis, I show that these seemingly inconsistent orientations to older age emerge out of the unfolding sequential context and the different projects in which participants are engaged in interaction. I further show that older age is not the only or main identity orientated to in such uses in this setting. The discussion as a whole highlights the value of adopting an age-blind approach to the data and of examining people's use of older-age terms and expressions in a range of ordinary settings.},

In Sociolinguistics, we know the concept of jargon. Jargon is the certain language that is usually used by group of society. Jargon is a language variety contain a set of unique vocabulary that used by people who have same interest, class (social status), or same position in certain area, for instance in working area. This study uses theory of Yule (1996, p.245) defines Jargon is one of the key features to register in a certain group, which can be defined as technical vocabularies associated with a special activity or group. There are three research problems of this study: (1) What are the jargons used by stylist in Rabel beauty salon (2) What are the jargons used by stylist in Rabel beauty salon (3) What are the possible reasons of using those jargons by stylist in Rabel beauty salon. This study uses qualitative descriptive approach because the writer describes the jargon used by stylist in Rabel beauty salon, the meanings and also the possible reasons  of using those jargons.  As  the data,  the writer uses  the utterances which contain jargon when the stylists talk among each other. The result of the interview is also regarded as the supporting data. The writer finds the stylists in Rabel beauty salon use 19 jargons when they are providing salon’s treatment. They use jargon for certain reasons. First it is done keep their secret talk. Secret here means that their talk that do not want to be known by other people who do not belong to this community. Second, they use jargon  to  build  their  own  identity.  They  want  their  community has  different characteristic from the others. The writer suggests that, hopefully, the future researcher presents better research. First is for the next researchers are expected to explore and investigate some other phenomena of jargon happen in society in any speech community in order to add other types of jargons, so it will be found more various languages than before. Second, try to investigate other studies in some linguistics field such as pragmatics, syntaxes, and others. The last suggestion, hopefully the next researchers have a lot of other theories which are support their study and make the sources to be more various.},

Vietnamese are shown to have simultaneously gained access to institutional means to surmount professional manicure credentializing barriers, and to have developed formal and informal ethnic networks that fueled their growing monopolization of jobs in the sector, to the exclusion of non-Vietnamese. The article also elucidates conditions contributing to the Vietnamese build-up and transformation of the niche, to the nation-wide formation of the niche and, most recently, to the transnationalization of the niche. It also extrapolates from the Vietnamese manicure experience propositions concerning the development, expansion, maintenance, and transnationalization of immigrant-formed labor market niches.},

	title = {Language and {Superdiversity}},
	volume = {13},
	abstract = {This paper explores the scope for research on language and superdiversity.1 Following a protracted process of paradigm shift, sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology are well placed to engage with the contemporary social changes associated with superdiversity. After a brief introductory discussion of what superdiversity entails, the paper outlines key theoretical and methodological developments in language study: named languages have now been denaturalized, the linguistic is treated as just one semiotic among many, inequality and innovation are positioned together in a dynamics of pervasive normativity, and the contexts in which people orient their interactions reach far beyond the communicative event itself. From here, this paper moves to a research agenda on superdiversity and language that is strongly embedded in ethnography. The combination of linguistics and ethnography produces an exceptionally powerful and differentiated view of both activity and ideology. After a characterization of what linguistic ethnography offers social science in general, this paper sketches some priorities for research on language and communication in particular, emphasizing the need for cumulative comparison, both as an objective in theory and description and as a resource for practical intervention.},

Ze troffen er van alles aan waarvoor het Nederlands geen woorden had - culturen, gebruiken, planten en dieren -, en dus breidden ze hun woordenschat uit met nieuwe termen. De grote deskundige op het gebied van dat Surinaamse Nederlands was de eerder dit jaar overleden bioloog Jan van Donselaar, auteur van het in 1977 verschenen (en in 1989 herziene) 'Woordenboek van het Surinaams-Nederlands'. Dat werk beschrijft het 'moderne' Surinaams-Nederlands, van pakweg de laatste honderdvijftig jaar, maar Van Donselaar is vrijwel tot zijn dood blijven werken aan een boek dat de voorgeschiedenis hiervan moest beschrijven: een lexicon van Surinaamse woorden die in gebruik waren tussen 1667 en 1876 (het jaar dat de leerplicht in Suriname werd ingevoerd). Zijn werk eraan heeft hij kunnen afronden, maar de publicatie van het woordenboek heeft hij net niet meer meegemaakt. Het is afgemaakt door Nicoline van der Sijs.},

	abstract = {In the situated learning approach, knowledge and skills are learned in contexts that reflect how knowledge is obtained and applied in everyday situations. As an instructional strategy, situated cognition is a means for relating subject matter to learners' needs and concerns. Four major premises guide the development of classroom activities for situated learning: learning is grounded in the actions of everyday situations; knowledge is acquired situationally and transfers only to similar situations; learning is the result of a social process encompassing ways of thinking, perceiving, problem solving, and interacting in addition to declarative and procedural knowledge; and learning is not separated from the world of action but exists in robust, complex, social environments made up  of actors, actions, and situations. Situated learning places learners in the center of an instructional process consisting of content, context, a community of practice, and participation. These four elements offer intriguing opportunities for educators to engage adult learners in novel and meaningful ways by creating environments that foster natural learning processes, selecting situations that will engage learners in complex and realistic problem-centered activities, acting first as content transmitters and eventually as facilitators of learning, and fostering the notion of cognitive apprenticeships.

Nonetheless, we still know very little about the emotional states of those actors whose daily decisions have a lasting impact on our societies: politicians in parliament. We address this question by making use of methods of natural language processing and a digitized corpus of text data spanning a century of parliamentary debates in the United Kingdom. We use this approach to examine changes in aggregate levels of emotional polarity in the British parliament, and to test a hypothesis about the emotional response of politicians to economic recessions. Our findings suggest that, contrary to popular belief, the mood of politicians has become more positive during the past decades, and that variations in emotional polarity can be predicted by the state of the national economy.},

Teenagers are often accused of 'lowering the standards' of the English language by the way they talk and text. From spoken words - 'like', 'so', 'just', and 'stuff' - to abbreviated expressions used online, this fascinating book puts young people's language under the microscope, examining and demystifying the origins of new words, and tracking how they vary according to gender, geographical location, and social circumstances.

This volume is a major advance towards that understanding. Professor Gumperz here synthesizes fundamental research on communication from a wide variety of disciplines - linguistics, sociolinguistics, anthropology and non-verbal communication - and develops an original and broadly based theory of conversational inference which shows how verbal communication can serve either between individuals of different social and ethnic backgrounds. The urgent need to overcome such barriers to effective communication is also a central concern of the book. Examples of conversational exchanges as well as of longer encounters, recorded in the urban United States, village Austria, South Asia and Britain, and analyzed to illustrate all aspects of the analytical approach, and to show how subconscious cultural presuppositions can damagingly affect interpretation of intent and judgement of interspeaker attitude. The volume will be of central interest to anyone concerned with communication, whether from a more academic viewpoint or as a professional working, for example, in the fields of interethnic or industrial relations.},

These languages also serve to bridge ethnic differences. Cases have been reported for Abidjan, Nairobi, Johannesburg, KinshasaBrazzaville, and Yaounde. We show that these urban youth languages have much in common, both in function and in the linguistic strategies that their speakers use. The strategies found are typical for conscious language manipulation in general. Languages that arise through lexical manipulation can be divided into four types according to their function and use. Urban youth languages fall into the category of what Halliday terms antilanguages, but differ from other instances of language manipulation such as argot, taboo, jargon, slang, secret languages, and in-law respect languages. The difference lies not only in their different functions, but also, and related to these, in a preference for the use of certain types of conscious manipulation above others. The primary function of these urban youth languages is to create a powerful icon of identity. The identity in question is established through the reversal of norms, and develops from an underdog type of identity to one aimed at reforming society.},

The purpose of this book is to explore one particular set of approaches to the topic which seems particularly useful for understanding what bilingualism might mean today, in this context of social change, and how new understandings of it, as ideology and practice, also contribute to linguistic and social theory. In particular, the book aims to move the field of bilingualism studies away from a ‘common-sense’, but in fact highly ideologized, view of bilingualism as the coexistence of two linguistic systems, and to develop a critical perspective which allows for a better grasp on the ways in which language practices are socially and politically embedded. The aim is to move discussions of bilingualism away from a focus on the whole bounded units of code and community, and towards a more processual and materialist approach which privileges language as social practice, speakers as social actors and boundaries as products of social action.},

THE PROBLEMATISATION OF ETHNICITY
AND SOCIALISATION
Ben Rampton


This paper begins in Section 1 by noting two processes that have been generally overlooked in sociolinguistics. Firstly, the prevailing approaches to ethnicity have tended to neglect the processes through which individuals can either adopt someone else's ethnicity, or get together with them and create a new one. Secondly, socialization in sociolinguistics is most commonly seen as enculturation into an ingroup, not as a process of learning to like and live with social and ethnic difference. To throw some light on these two processes, the paper turns its focus towards a practice it calls 'language crossing' ('code crossing', 'crossing').
Language crossing involves code alternation by people who are not accepted members of the group associated with the second language that they are using (code switching into varieties that are not generally thought to belong to them). This kind of switching involves a distinct sense of movement across social or ethnic boundaries and it raises issues of legitimacy which, in one way or another, participants need to negotiate in the course of their encounter. A fuller account of the intricate dialectic between language, peer group belonging and ethnic otherness that lies at the heart of language crossing emerges as the paper proceeds. After some methodological preliminaries (Section 2) and an outline of some of the ways in which the multiracial peer group I studied can be considered a community (Section 3), the empirical description of crossing itself begins with an initial emphasis on the way that crossing was integrated with what was shared in peer group culture (Section 4). The following section (Section 5) turns to the way in which crossing processed ethnic division and race stratification within the peer group, and this is further elaborated in the discussion of socialisation in Section 6. Section 7 contains a conclusion which briefly links crossing's treatment of ethnicity with Bourdieu's discussion of doxa, orthodoxv and heretical discourse.},

We discuss recent evidence that bilingualism is associated with a delay in the onset of symptoms of dementia. Cognitive reserve is a crucial research area in the context of an aging population; the possibility that bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve is therefore of growing importance as populations become increasingly diverse.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present diachronic changes in terms of the conditions of first language acquisition.
Grammars, seen as mental organs, may change between two generations.  A change is initiated when (a population of) learners converge on a grammatical system which differs in at least one parameter value from the system internalized by the speakers of the previous generation.  Learnability issues then connect to both language acquisition and language change, and understanding language changes depends on understanding how children acquire their native language.  Acquisition is a process in which Universal Grammar (UG) interacts with a context-specific set of Primary Linguistic Data (PLD: the linguistic input to the child-learner) and uses these PLD as the source for triggers or cues that map the innate (preexperience) knowledge to a mature grammar.
If a certain phenomenon has survived through many generations, it must have been reflected clearly in the PLD.  Then, if we note that it has changed, something in the language performance of the previous generation must have changed, and thereby paved the way for a new interpretation.  Innovation leading to linguistic variation in the PLD and gradual changes in PLD play a central role in the explanation here: the immediate cause of a grammar change must lie in some alternation in the PLD.  We will look at how the language spoken in a certain community (E-language) may gradually become different from the language that originally served as the triggering experience.  These changes in the E-language also mean changes in the input available to the child-learners of the next generation and a motivation for a different parameter setting has arisen.},

Although the observations suggest that the acquisition of inflection is influenced by age, there is no study that focuses on this particular issue nor is there an articulated explanation available for the observed age-related difference. In this contribution, we compare child L2 learners of Dutch to child L1 and adult L2 learners of Dutch in order to investigate effects of age on the acquisition of verbal and adjectival inflection. We hypothesize that adult agreement paradigms differ from child agreement paradigms, the reason being that adult learners cannot rely on syntactic cues, whereas children make reliable use of syntax in building paradigms. By effect, adult learners end up with non-targetlike small paradigms that contain underspecified suffixes. We focus on the types of errors in the three learner groups (child L1, child L2 and adult L2). Our empirical basis consists of results obtained in a series of production experiments.},

The authors argue that comprehensively documenting complex linguistic phenomena requires taking into account the views of all local social actors (native and non native speakers, institutions, linguists, non-speakers etc.), applying a range of complementary data collection and analysis methods and putting issues of ideology, variation, language contact and interaction centre stage.

	abstract = {Most African languages are spoken by communities as one of several languages present on a daily basis. The persistence of multilingualism and the linguistic creativity manifest in the playful use of different languages are striking, especially against the backdrop of language death and expanding monolingualism elsewhere in the world. The effortless mastery of several languages is disturbing, however, for those who take essentialist perspectives that see it as a problem rather than a resource, and for the dominating, conflictual, sociolinguistic model of multilingualism. This volume investigates African minority languages in the context of changing patterns of multilingualism, and also assesses the status of African languages in terms of existing influential vitality scales. An important aspect of multilingual praxis is the speakers' agency in making choices, their repertoires of registers and the multiplicity of language ideology associated with different ways of speaking. The volume represents a new and original contribution to the ethnography of speaking of multilingual practices and the cultural ideas associated with them.},

	abstract = {Collections of grammatically annotated texts (corpora), and in particular, parsed corpora, present a challenge to current methods of analysis. Such corpora are large and highly structured heterogeneous data sources. In this paper we briefly describe the parsed one-million word ICE-GB corpus, and the ICECUP query system. We then consider the application of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) to text corpora. Following Cupit and Shadbolt (Proceedings 9th European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop, EKAW '96; Berlin: Springer Verlag, pp. 245–261, 1996), we argue that effective linguistic knowledge discovery must be based on a process of redescription or, more precisely, abstraction, based on the research question to be investigated. Abstraction maps relevant elements from the corpus to an abstract model of the research topic. This mapping may be implemented using a grammatical query representation such as ICECUP's Fuzzy Tree Fragments (FTFs). Since this abstractive process must be both experimental and expert-guided, ultimately a workbench is necessary to maintain, evaluate and refine the abstract model. We conclude with a pilot study, employing our approach, into aspects of noun phrase postmodifying clause structure. The data is analysed using the UNIT machine learning algorithm to search for significant interactions between domain variables. We show that our results are commensurable with those published in the linguistics literature, and discuss how the methodology may be improved.},

Those published to date have largely been from the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Testaments of Toluca presents a large body of Nahuatl wills (98) from 1652 to 1783 from an important valley not much studied, thus greatly enlarging our perspective on the evolution of indigenous society and culture in central Mexico. Each testament is transcribed, translated, and accompanied by a commentary on the testator's situation and on interesting terminology. A substantial introductory study fully analyzes the testamentary genre as seen in this corpus (a first) and summarizes the content of the documents in realms such as gender, kinship, household, and land. Wills are very human documents, and the apparatus draws out this aspect, telling us much about indigenous life in central Mexico in the third century after Spanish contact. All this makes the book of potential interest to a broad spectrum of readers."--BOOK JACKET.  xv, 250 p. : ill. ; 29 cm. Nahuas -- History -- Sources.

We argue that key innovations in Nahuatl during the colonial period are either borrowed from Spanish or begin as minor internal patterns that gradually become dominant due to similarity with an element of Spanish structure, and that these two processes have driven typological change in the language.},

This study focuses on the use and meaning of grammatical markers of tense, aspect, and modality and identifies a universal set of grammatical categories. The authors demonstrate that the semantic content of these categories evolves gradually and that this process of evolution is strikingly similar across unrelated languages.  Through a survey of seventy-six languages in twenty-five different phyla, the authors show that the same paths of change occur universally and that movement along these paths is in one direction only. This analysis reveals that lexical substance evolves into grammatical substance through various mechanisms of change, such as metaphorical extension and the conventionalization of implicature. Grammaticization is always accompanied by an increase in frequency of the grammatical marker, providing clear evidence that language use is a major factor in the evolution of synchronic language states.  The Evolution of Grammar has important implications for the development of language and for the study of cognitive processes in general.},

This book is an introduction to the subject, covering individual and societal multilingualism, the acquisition of two or more languages from birth, second language acquisition in adulthood, language change, linguistic typology, language processing and the structure of the language faculty. It explains the effects of multilingualism on society and language policy, as well as the consequences that long-term bilingualism within communities can have for the structure of languages. Drawing on the author's own first-hand observations of child and adult bilingualism, the book provides a clear analysis of such phenomena as language convergence, grammatical borrowing, and mixed languages.},

It addresses not only the structure and the function, but also the ideological values of such bilingual behaviour. The contributors question many views of code switching on the empirical basis of many European and non European contexts. By bringing together linguistics, anthropological and socio-psychological research, they move towards a more realistic conception of bilingual conversation action.},

	abstract = {The goal of this book, a companion volume to Social Motivations for Codeswitching (Oxford, 1993) is to describe and explain intrasentential codeswitching--the production of two or more languages within the same sentence. Most linguists who do not study codeswitching think of it as belonging strictly in the domain of sociolinguistics. Most codeswitching studies do indeed have a social aspect, because they typically use naturally occurring performance data as their base. This book, however, is just as much a study in grammatical theory as a study of language in use. The specific research question addressed is this: when speakers alternate between two or more linguistic varieties, how free is this alternation from the structural point of view? Carol Myers-Scotton develops a model of the morphosyntactic constraints on codeswitching and concludes that the principles governing codeswitching are the same everywhere.},

Making a deliberate distinction between ‘massacre’ and ‘genocide’, the editors call for an entirely separate and new subject under the rubric of ‘Massacre Studies’, dealing with mass killings that are not genocidal in intent. This volume offers a reflection on the nature of mass killings and extreme violence across regions and across centuries, and brings together a wide range of approaches and case studies.},

This paper attempts to address this lacuna. It discusses its history and selected areas of grammar in order to assess the place of Matawai among its sister languages and its development. The linguistic analysis draws on recordings from 2013 and the 1970s. The paper provides evidence to support the view that Matawai is most closely related to Saamaka. However, there are also features that are unique to Matawai and those that appear to be due to either patterns of language contact with the other creoles of Suriname or common inheritance. The paper argues that systematic corpus-based analysis of lesser-used varieties provides new insights into existing debates.},

	abstract = {We define the relevant information in a signal \$x{\textbackslash}in X\$ as being the information that this signal provides about another signal \$y{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Y\$. Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal \$x\$ requires more than just predicting \$y\$, it also requires specifying which features of \${\textbackslash}X\$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for \${\textbackslash}X\$ that preserves the maximum information about \${\textbackslash}Y\$. That is, we squeeze the information that \${\textbackslash}X\$ provides about \${\textbackslash}Y\$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords \${\textbackslash}tX\$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure \$d(x,{\textbackslash}x)\$ emerges from the joint statistics of \${\textbackslash}X\$ and \${\textbackslash}Y\$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules \$X {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}tX\$ and \${\textbackslash}tX {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}Y\$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Language has a fundamentally social function. Processes of human interaction along with domain-general cognitive processes shape the structure and knowledge of language. Recent research in the cognitive sciences has demonstrated that patterns of use strongly affect how language is acquired, is used, and changes. These processes are not independent of one another but are facets of the same complex adaptive system (CAS). Language as a CAS involves the following key features: The system consists of multiple agents (the speakers in the speech community) interacting with one another. The system is adaptive; that is, speakers’ behavior is based on their past interactions, and current and past interactions together feed forward into future behavior. A speaker's behavior is the consequence of competing factors ranging from perceptual constraints to social motivations. The structures of language emerge from interrelated patterns of experience, social interaction, and cognitive mechanisms. The CAS approach reveals commonalities in many areas of language research, including first and second language acquisition, historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, language evolution, and computational modeling.},

	abstract = {The town of Wilamowice (southern Poland) is the unique home to the community of speakers of Wymysiöeryś. The language enclave originates from Colonial Middle High German and – according to diachronic dialectological analyses – is made up of a sub-exclave of the so-called Bielitz-Bialaer Sprachinsel. As a result of social and political cataclysms brought by the Second World War and the following ban on and gap in its intergenerational transmission, it faced an inescapable language death. That doom, however, has been restrained by the activities of dedicated native speakers, with Tymoteusz Król (born in 1993) functioning as an eco- and sociolinguistic relay between the generation of last speakers passing away and, unexpectedly, a growing group of potential new speakers. The microlanguage, now spoken as native by fewer than 20 Wilamowiceans, and still without any official recognition at the administrative level, is experiencing an astonishing, but well-prepared and local culture-based revitalisation course. This article discusses the recent achievements and prospective challenges of the revival processes for Wymysiöeryś – from an internal (including T. Król as the youngest native speaker and intra-community researcher) and external yet engaged (J. Olko and T. Wicherkiewicz as participating academics) perspectives, including the recent results of activities undertaken within an integral revitalisation programme based on the successful collaboration of the community, two major universities in Poland, as well as the local school and municipal authorities. The programme covers all three levels of language planning: corpus, status and acquisition. Efficiently combining grassroots and top-down approaches, the collaborating actors also ground language revitalisation in the social, cultural and economical benefits of preserving and extending the local cultural heritage and linguistic landscape.},

Our data, which come from a larger study of Francoprovençal (FP), show significant intraspeaker variation. Sociolinguistic interviews were carried out in the Lyonnais region of France among 21 FP speakers with different acquisition routes. /l/-palatalisation is far from categorical in our sample, with increased rates of the French variant [l] over the traditional [j] variant. We interpret these data as contact-induced change: phonological leveling is underway, with convergence towards French. These findings are consistent with the language death literature, and are now widely reported in the context of other minority varieties spoken in the Hexagon. Conversely, some new speakers show different patterns with a greater range of palatalised variants. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggest laterals to be a locus for socio-indexical cues cross-linguistically.},

They offer new sections on dialectometry and mapping variability, a revised section on dialect geography as well as updates of other recent developments. A reliable textbook for over seventeen years, this new edition will continue to serve the needs of undergraduates and individual scholars with its comprehensive coverage of methods, models and findings in the study of language variation and change.},

Addressing persistent and current Aboriginal health inequities requires considering both the contexts in which disparities exist and innovative and culturally appropriate means of rectifying those inequities. The present article contextualizes Aboriginal children’s health disparities, considers ‘determinants’ of health as opposed to biomedical explanations of ill health and concludes with ways to intervene in health inequities. Aboriginal children experience a greater burden of ill health compared with other children in Canada, and these health inequities have persisted for too long. A change that will impact individuals, communities and nations, a change that will last beyond seven generations, is required. Applying a social determinants of health framework to health inequities experienced by Aboriginal children can create that change.},

	abstract = {Typology has the hallmarks of a mature discipline: a society, conferences, journals, books, textbooks, classic works, a founding father, and people who are called and call themselves typologists. A typologist probably teaches a course with a title like “Typology and Universals” which includes readings by Greenberg, Dixon, and Dryer, often a textbook such as Whaley (1997), Comrie (1989), Song (2001), and/or Croft (2003), and some grammar-reading assignments. With regard to research, the typologist reads grammars, does at least some crosslinguistic research, has probably done some fieldwork and description, and usually does not identify with or claim allegiance to any particular named theoretical framework. Despite these conspicuous identifying marks, I submit that the position of typologists on this should be that there is no such subfield of linguistics as the usual referent of “typology”.},

	abstract = {The origin of the words \$lsquo;cacao\$rsquo; and 
\$lsquo;chocolate\$rsquo; and their use in the reconstruction 
of the early history of Mesoamerica, remain very controversial 
issues. Cambell and Kaufman (1976, American Antiquity 
41:80–89), for example, proposed that the word \$lsquo;cacao\$rsquo; 
originated from Mixe–Zoque languages, thus possibly 
representing Olmec traditions. According to this argument, 
other Mesoamerican languages, including Nahuatl, borrowed 
the word as a symbol of prestige and Olmec influence. Other 
researchers claim the word \$lsquo;chocolate\$rsquo; represents 
a more recent neologism, a possible Maya–Nahuatl 
hybrid, due to the late appearance of the word in central 
Mexico's Colonial sources. We refute the putative 
Mixe–Zoque origin of \$lsquo;cacao\$rsquo; and provide 
linguistic evidence to propose that \$lsquo;cacao,\$rsquo; 
like \$lsquo;chocolate,\$rsquo; is a Uto-Aztecan term. Analysis 
of these words highlights general and particular evolutionary 
trends that originate from the Uto-Aztecan language family. 
In addition, we show that these two words were initially 
used as descriptive terms to refer to the shape of the 
plant's bean and the techniques of drink preparation. 
Etymological evidence verifies the use of a Mayan term 
for cacao as early as the Classic period (fourth century 
a.d.). This early appearance of the term in Mayan 
and the later diffusion of the Nahua word throughout all 
of Mesoamerica correlate with additional data to support 
the conclusion that Teotihuacanos spoke Nahuatl.},

Our competence, intelligence, friendliness, trustworthiness, social status, group memberships, and so on, are often judged from the way we communicate. Even the speed at which we speak can evoke reactions. And we often try to anticipate such judgements as we communicate. In this lively introduction, Peter Garrett draws upon research carried out over recent decades in order to discuss such attitudes and the implications they have for our use of language, for social advantage or discrimination, and for social identity. Using a range of examples that includes punctuation, words, grammar, pronunciation, accents, dialects and languages, this book explores the intricate and fascinating ways in which language influences our everyday thoughts, feelings and behaviour.},

It is considered from the perspective of different concepts of language and speech communities, in order to show how both concepts are intricately intertwined in endangered language communities. The issue of language endangerment in communities is approached from the perspective of the evolution of their level of consciousness and their evolving attitudes, in the context of recently developed discourse about the preservation of worldwide biocultural diversity. Linguists working on endangered languages often find themselves in challenging field situations that their academic training has done little to prepare them for.},

The Proto-Uto-Aztecan speech community was probably located in Mesoamerica and spread northward into the present range because of demographic pressure associated with cultivation.

Language is understood as a part of complex socio-historical-cultural systems, and interaction between the different dimensions and levels of these systems is considered to be essential for specific language forms. This book presents a uniform, abstract model of linguistic ecology based on, among other things, two concepts of Edmund Husserl's philosophy (parts and wholes, and foundation). It considers the individual speaker in the specific communication situation to be the essential heuristic basis of linguistic analysis. The chapters present and employ a new, transparent and accessible contact linguistic vocabulary to aid reader comprehension, and explore a wide range of language contact situations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Asia and the Pacific. This book will be fascinating reading for students and researchers across contact linguistics and cultural studies.},

	abstract = {The discovery of words in a Nahua language on a Maya ceramic vessel 
provides evidence of Nahua influence in the Maya region as early as 
a.d. 480, centuries earlier than previously believed. The words 
are spelled in syllabic Maya signs painted on a pot known to have 
contained chocolate (Hall et al. 1990). The 
words occur within the context of the primary standard sequence, a 
well-known Maya formula, and describe the chocolate drink that among the 
later Mexica (Aztec) was reserved for “rulers and esteemed 
noblewomen.” This new reading supports the Uto-Aztecan etymology of 
cacao proposed by Karin Dakin and Søren Wichmann (2000) and their assertion that an economically and 
militarily powerful Nahua-speaking people were responsible for the spread 
of the word cacao into southern Mesoamerica. More broadly, these 
findings have implications for the role of Uto-Aztecan speakers in the 
formation and spread of Mesoamerican civilization.},

	abstract = {This paper is part of a larger, ongoing PhD-project carried out at the K.U.Leuven in Belgium. The project investigates the linguistic effect of intensive bilingualism on Italian as a subordinate language for two generations of Italian-Dutch bilinguals who reside in Limburg, the easternmost region of Flanders, Belgium. The study examines language contact phenomena (language variation and language change) and specific speech patterns and the main purpose is to determine whether different types of grammatical phenomena (morphological, syntactic and lexical) in the speech of bilinguals are affected by language contact in the same way. It also seeks to determine whether the identified changes can be explained on the basis of the processes that are recognized in the literature (Muysken 2001; SilvaCorvalán 1994; Van Coetsem 1995) as characteristic of language contact, namely simplification and transfer. Finally, the project verifies in which way these features correlate with social factors. Until now very few studies on ‘migrant Italian’ in Europe have been carried out up, and most of them have focused on language attrition of the first generation. As far as concerns the Italian language in Belgium, most of the studies on second generation Italians in Flanders concern language behaviour, as eg. language shift (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1991) or school problems of children of migrant workers (Jacqmain 1978a; 1978b; 1979). For the second and third generation Italians, which constitute the group we have opted for, the concept of language loss is composite. In fact, the language of these two generations is the result of a series of phenomena that characterize linguistic evolution in emigrant communities and that can be classified under the general denominator of language loss. A first process is the language attrition of the first generation Italians, due to migration and the social distance from the community of native speakers. Furthermore, a large number of first generation Italians did not speak standard Italian when they immigrated to Belgium, they all spoke their own regional variant. The language they developed by talking with other Italians coming from other regions of Italy was a sort of ‘lingua franca’, often called Italiano popolare (Berruto 1983; Lepschy 1983; 1989a; 1989b; 1989c), to which we will return later in this paper. It is this language that was then passed on to the next generations. The second process that determined the language of the next generations is language shift. Studies on language shift among Italians in Flanders showed that Italian is not used anymore, only in family contexts, i.e. in the presence of grandparents or other first generation Italians that most of the time do not speak Dutch (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1991). The informants who collaborated in my fieldwork (cfr. infra) firmly expressed that they would spontaneously start a conversation in Dutch, rather than in Italian. Although they continue to speak it and although they make efforts to maintain it, for instance by planning frequent holidays in Italy, watching news on Italian television channels and buying Italian journals or magazines, more and more second --and obviously third--generation Italians speak mainly Dutch in every day life, even if they live in a community with many Italians. Dutch has clearly become the dominant language and will continue to influence the language of future generations. As a direct consequence of the previous processes, the third process that defines the language of our target group is the so-called incomplete language acquisition (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1986), due to the},

	abstract = {Contact Linguistics is a critical investigation of what happens to the grammars of languages when bilingual speakers use both their languages in the same clause. It consolidates earlier insights and presents the new theoretical and empirical work of a scholar whose ideas have had a fundamental impact on the field. It also shows that bilingual data offer a revealing window on the structure of the language faculty. Carol Myers-Scotton examines the nature of major contact phenomena, especially lexical borrowing, grammatical convergence, codeswitching, first language attrition, mixed languages, and the development of creoles. She argues forcefully that types of contact phenomena often seen as separate in fact result from the same processes and can be explained by the same principles. Her discussion centers around two new models derived from the Matrix Language Frame model, previously applied only to codeswitching. One model recognizes four types of morphemes based on their different patterns of distribution across contact phenomena; its key hypothesis is that distribution depends on differential access to the morphemes in the production process. The other analyzes three levels of abstract lexical structure whose splitting and recombination across languages in bilingual speech explains many contact outcomes. This is an important volume, of unusual relevance for theories of competence and performance and vital for all those concerned with language contact. Carol Myers-Scotton is a Carolina Distinguished Professor of Linguistics at the University of South Carolina. She is a specialist in language contact phenomena and sociolinguistics and has a special interest in East and Southern African linguistics. In 1993, she published two volumes on codeswitching, Social Motivations for Codeswitching: Evidence from Africa, and Duelling Languages: Grammatical Structure in Codeswitching (both OUP). She has also edited a volume of essays on language and literature (OUP 1998) and published many articles in her areas of interest.},

	shorttitle = {Language attitudes and educational opportunities},
	abstract = {The cultural, economic and sociolinguistic trajectory of native communities in Mexico can be explained by some aspects of acculturation theory, in which ethnolinguistic vitality is an essential predictive component. I argue that at least in the first two or even three centuries of contact successful integration strategies seem to have co-existed with separation. Many Indigenous communities demonstrated considerable resilience and ethnolinguistic vitality during the colonial period, but the situation has changed drastically in modern times. This significant transformation came in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when integrational and separationist forms of existence gradually gave way to assimilation and marginalization. These changes were of course part of complex social, political and economic processes, especially the dispossession of corporate Indigenous land that has led to the undermining of native economies and their sustainable ways of subsistence. Also racism and negative language ideologies have been widely internalized by members of Indigenous communities. The perceived low economic value of the heritage language versus Spanish and English is still supported both by the dynamics of economic and social relations in the communities and by the conditions imposed by the external job market and its mechanisms of social advancement. Cultural dispossession is probably most profound and difficult to reverse or counteract if the language of the community is lost. While diagnosing these adverse processes, this paper also discusses the opportunities for challenging economic marginalization 2 and cultural dispossession of Indigenous groups, including both community-driven initiatives and collaborative projects embracing academic and Indigenous agents. Showing how language loss has been largely provoked by assimilationist educational policies, I also argue that reversing these negative processes can be achieved by collaborative educational strategies, the empowerment of speakers and the development of spaces for practicing Indigenous research, teaching and language activism.},

We argue that key innovations in Nahuatl during the colonial period are either borrowed from Spanish or begin as minor internal patterns that gradually become dominant due to similarity with an element of Spanish structure, and that these two processes have driven typological change in the language.},

	abstract = {Group vitality is a widely invoked construct in the study of minority language maintenance and interethnic relations. Per the original framework introduced 40 years ago, the more vitality an ethnolinguistic group perceives itself to have, the more likely that it will thrive as a collective entity in an intergroup context. Consequently, research adopting this paradigm—herein termed vitality theory—has studied ways in which objective and subjective group vitality has manifested itself in the endurance of ethnolinguistic groups. The notion of objective vitality includes the factors of demographics, institutional support, and status that characterize the strength of a group in comparison to others present in an intergroup setting. Contrastively, subjective vitality was introduced to highlight how groups may cognitively and affectively perceive these same factors.
            A large body of empirical research has been conducted within the vitality theory framework that has resulted in several stages of development. Evidence has shown that while the components of objective vitality (demographics, institutional support, status) do not typically manifest themselves as distinct components in the structure of subjective vitality, they do form a single component reflecting the perceived strength of the group. In addition, several other social psychological factors, such as perception of the legitimacy of intergroup relations, the level of ethnocentrism, and perception of intergroup distance, were incorporated into models of subjective vitality. Relatedly, these factors are shaped into group members’ discourse of vitality, which is a highly dialogical process of negotiation of subjective vitality of the groups engaged in intergroup contact.
            The vitality framework has been usefully invoked beyond ethnolinguistic groups, embracing several intergroup settings including age, gender, and sexual orientation. Vitality, which has provoked some controversy in the literature, has also been widely adopted by very different approaches as an umbrella term to denote the long-term sustainability of a group. Scholars in linguistics, sociology, psychology, education, anthropology, and beyond have contributed much to the concept, helping to educate and raise awareness as to why languages die out and the effects of such languages dying out.},

	abstract = {This introduction poses the central question of this special issue: how did New Spain’s colonial institutions and ethnically diverse colonial subjects use Nahuatl to administer and navigate a multilingual society? In response, I lay out a framework drawn from the articles and my own research that emphasizes the following themes: the importance of place and regional context in studies of language use; cleavages and connections between writing and speaking; language acquisition at the interface of the institutional and quotidian in colonial society; and language use as a means of shaping and negotiating interethnic relations and social status. I close the introduction by suggesting new avenues for research, including language use in everyday life, the development of regional forms of languages, and the making of language ideologies locally and colonywide. Multilingualism posed a conundrum to New Spain’s rulers, administrators, and evangelizers from colonialism’s inception to its conclusion and beyond. It also presents a fascinating and vexing puzzle for historians interested in the intersections of language, culture, and society. The essays in this special issue focus on one particular piece of this puzzle: the use of Nahuatl as a lingua franca, vehicular language, and language of quotidian interactions in multilingual regions throughout colonial Mesoamerica.1 By way of introduction, I offer the following framework with which to consider some major issues raised by the essays: the importance of place and regional context in studies of language use; cleavages and connections between writing and speaking; and how the study of language acquisition affords glimpses of the interface between the institutional and quotidian in colonial lives. A variety of locales figure in these essays, some at the urban heart of New Spain and others at the fringes of the viceroyalty. In Robert C.

Not surprisingly, Mexico City and its environs also figure prominently in R. Schwaller’s study as well as in Mark Z. Christensen’s essay, “The Use of Nahuatl in Evangelization and the New World Ministry of Sebastian,” which analyzes Nahuatllanguage Christian texts written for purposes of evangelization. Martin Nesvig’s essay, “Spanish Men, Indigenous Language, and Informal Interpreters in Postcontact Mexico,” is set in a multiethnic and overwhelmingly indigenous imperial periphery in the former Tarascan empire in the diocese of Michoacan, where Nahuatl served as a language for trade and colonial administration. Missionary priests, the protagonists of John F. Schwaller’s essay, “The Expansion of Nahuatl as a Lingua Franca among Priests in SixteenthCentury Mexico,” were trained in Nahuatl in order to evangelize indigenous groups in farflung regions of New Spain where Nahuatl was not the autochthonous language but had been introduced as a language of trade and empire by central Mexicans. Central Mexicans (Mexicanos) are also protagonists in Laura E. Matthew and Sergio F. Romero’s essay “Nahuatl and Pipil in Colonial Guatemala: A Central American Counterpoint,” but this time in their role as military allies to Spanish conquerors. Guatemala’s multiethnic Indian conquistadors, many of whom hailed from Central Mexico but some from Oaxaca and other regions, used Nahuatl to communicate among themselves and with the locals they encountered in their postconquest role as colonial administrators, making Nahuatl and Castilian the “cooperative languages of conquest.” Of particular note in the Matthew and Romero piece is their emphasis on the circulation and mutual influences of different written forms of Nahuatl: the classical form from Central Mexico; Pipil, a variety spoken on the Pacific coast of Central America; and what the authors call “Central American Colonial Nahuatl,” an imitative form of Classical Nahuatl that exhibited features of the other two. Each place to which these essays take us represents a setting for the engendering of Nahuatl as a common language among indigenous groups and among indigenous and nonindigenous people. The administrative, social, and economic roles played by the Nahuatlspeaking intermediaries in these settings often implied high geographical mobility, commerce, and the need for interethnic communication. Thus these essays approach the social history of language in colonial Mesoamerica by focusing squarely on Downloaded from https://read.dukeupress.edu/ethnohistory/article-pdf/59/4/667/410428/EH594\_01Yannakakis\_Fpp.pdf by guest on 07 December 2018},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
		In this paper, the author discusses one of the aspects of creole genesis from a population genetics perspective, analogizing 'language' with 'population' (rather than 'organism', the tradition in linguistics) and 'linguistic feature' with 'gene'. With language contact analogized to population contact, individual speakers are given a greater role than traditionally accorded them in the literature and variation within language is made more natural. Like genes, linguistic features are shown as competing with each other for selection into creoles' systems, in the different, though similar, ecologies of individual language contacts. It is argued here that the founder populations, including speakers of both lexifiers and substrate languages, played greater roles than hitherto considered in determining which specific features received selective advantage over their competitors during the formation of creoles. The Founder Principle explains why some European languages in their nonstandard forms became the principal lexifiers when others could have and why some specific features prevailed in the new systems. The competition-of-features perspective allows deterministic influences of both the lexifiers and substrate languages, thanks to convergence and other markedness principles, with the bioprogram qua Universal Grammar serving as the body of principles regulating the development of the new vernaculars.
		RÉSUMÉ
		Dans cet article l'auteur discute un des aspects de la genèse des creoles du point de vue de la génétique des populations. Il y compare la notion de 'langue' à celle de 'population' (plutôt qu'à celle d"organisme', la tradition en linguistique) et celle de 'trait linguistique' à celle de 'gène'. Cette comparaison du contact de langues à celui de populations accorde aux locuteurs un rôle plus grand qu'il n'est de coutume dans la littérature; la variation dans la langue se montre ainsi plus naturelle. Comme les gènes, les traits linguistiques se présentent en compétition mutuelle pour être sélectionnés dans les systèmes des creoles, dans des écologies différentes, bien que semblables, des contacts langagiers individuels. Selon mon hypothèse, la population fondatrice, y compris les locuteurs autant des langues lexificatrices que des langues substrates, ont joué des rôles plus importants qu'on leur reconnaît à présent en déterminant quels traits spécifiques ont eu un avantage sélectif par rapport à leurs alternatives pendant la formation des creoles. Le Principe Fondateur explique pourquoi quelques langues européennes dans leurs formes non standard sont devenues les principales lexificatrices, plutôt que d'autres langues qui auraient pu faire autant, et pourqoi quelques traits spécifiques se sont imposés dans les nouveaux systèmes. La perspective de la compétition des traits rend possible des influences déterministes à la fois des langues lexificatrices que des langues substrates, étant donné la convergence de certains de leurs traits et grace à d'autres principes sur lesquels est basé l'opposition marqué/non marqué. La Grammaire Universelle fonctionne dans mon hypothèse comme un corps de principes régissant le développement des nouveaux vernaculaires.
		ZUSAMMENFASSUNG
		Im vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert der Autor einen Aspekt der Genese von Kreolsprachen aus der Sicht einer Bevölkerungsgenetik, dabei eine Analogie zwischen 'Sprache' und 'Population' (anstelle von 'Organismus', wie es in der Linguistik Tradition ist) und zwischen 'sprachlicher Erscheinung' und 'Gen' herstellend. Wenn Sprachkontakt mit Populationskontakt in Analogie gesetzt wird, erhalten die Einzelprecher eine größere Rolle als ihnen gewöhnlich in der Forschung zuerkannt werden, und Variation innerhalb einer Sprache wird auf diese Weise ein weit natürlicherer Vorgang. Genen vergleichbar, konkurrieren linguïstische Eigenschaften untereinander um die Auswahl für das System einer Kreolsprache innerhalb der verschiedenen, wenngleich ähnlichen, 'Ökologien' individueller Sprachkontakte. Es wird hier die Behauptung aufgestellt, daß die 'Gründungspopulationen', inklusive der Sprecher von sowohl lexifizierenden als auch Substratsprachen, größere Rollen spielen als man bisher bei der Bestim-mung berücksichtigt hat, welche besondere Eigenschaften selektive Vorteile gegenüber anderen bei der Herausbildung von Kreolsprachen erhalten haben. Das 'Gründerprinzip' erklärt, weshalb einige europäische Sprachen in ihren nicht-standardisierten Formen die hauptsachlichen Lieferanten von Wortstruk-turen geworden sind, wenn andere es hatten werden können, und weshalb gewisse Eigenschaften in diesen neuem System die Oberhand gewannen. Der Gesichts-punkt eines Wettkampfs zwischen Eigenschaften ermöglicht bestimmbare Ein-flüsse auf sowohl von lexifizierenden als auch Substratsprachen, und zwar dank einer Konvergenz und anderer Merkmalprinzipien, wobei ein 'Bioprogramm' oder eine Universaliengrammatik als die Grundlage dazu dient, die Entwicklung neuer Volkssprachen zu regulieren.},

We apply Biber’s (1988) method of multidimensional analysis to examine the co-occurrence of linguistic features in the British and Australian Hansard over five consecutive time periods. The data provide evidence of shared as well as differentiated effects of colloquialization and densification across the two varieties. The evidence also points to a new type of anti-colloquial trend observed in the parliamentary register, whereby presentation of information appears to be taking the place of a more interactive and interpersonally oriented style, a trend we term “monologization.”},

              Previous research suggests there are register differences between native and non-native varieties of English, as well as translated English. This article reports on a multidimensional (MD) analysis of register variation in the published written registers of 16 varieties of English, and tests expectations for register variation in contact varieties evident from existing research. The study finds that the effects of
              variety
              and
              register
              are largely independent of each other, indicating that overall, registers pattern in similar ways across varieties.
              register
              is the strongest factor accounting for variance in the data, but
              variety
              also contributes significantly to variation. Non-native varieties before phase four in the Dynamic Model (
              Schneider 2007
              ) and translations draw more extensively on markers of formality than non-native varieties at phase four and native varieties. Contact varieties display fewer involvement features than native varieties. Persuasive strategies and reported speech are variable across varieties, suggesting local stylistic and cultural differences.},

	abstract = {Schafer \& Roeper (2000) have traced the acquisition order of the various occurrences of
              there
              in English monolingual children. One of their claims is that expletive
              there
              triggers the emergence of
              there
              as a discourse anaphor. Taking their approach as a starting point, we report here on a similar search that we have carried out on files from Dutch corpora in CHILDES, focussing on the two Dutch counterparts
              daar
              and
              er
              . Dutch children face a particular acquisition puzzle in having to deal with both of these equivalents for ‘
              there
              ’. Our results show that discourse anaphoric
              daar
              and
              er
              emerge prior to expletive
              er
              . This clearly contradicts Schafer \& Roeper’s claim for the need of an expletive trigger. We argue instead that the discrepancy between the English and Dutch findings is caused by the much larger variety of discourse anaphoric constructions with
              daar
              and
              er
              in Dutch.},
