Reference Repo
==============
After years of using Zotero, it's time to move on to something more sensible. I started using bibmanager (the python package) to manage bibtex entries. I'm keeping a repo online because I'm usually working with more than one computer and, like now I need to go to a specific machine to generate a reference list â€“ how irritating. With this all refs will be available. 

Theres also a custom shell script `add_bib.sh` to add a bib to the bibm db and move/rename the file to a dedicated directory.
