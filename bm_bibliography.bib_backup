    abstract = { Advances in communication technologies offer new opportunities for the conduct of qualitative research. Among these, Zoom—an innovative videoconferencing platform—has a number of unique features that enhance its potential appeal to qualitative and mixed-methods researchers. Although studies have explored the use of information and communication technologies for conducting research, few have explored both researcher and participant perspectives on the use of web and videoconferencing platforms. Further, data are lacking on the benefits and challenges of using Zoom as a data collection method. In this study, we explore the feasibility and acceptability of using Zoom to collect qualitative interview data within a health research context in order to better understand its suitability for qualitative and mixed-methods researchers. We asked 16 practice nurses who participated in online qualitative interviews about their experiences of using Zoom and concurrently recorded researcher observations. Although several participants experienced technical difficulties, most described their interview experience as highly satisfactory and generally rated Zoom above alternative interviewing mediums such as face-to-face, telephone, and other videoconferencing services, platforms, and products. Findings suggest the viability of Zoom as a tool for collection of qualitative data because of its relative ease of use, cost-effectiveness, data management features, and security options. Further research exploring the utility of Zoom is recommended in order to critically assess and advance innovations in online methods. }

        abstract = { Aims and objectives:The aim of this study is to investigate language contact from a usage-based perspective. In particular, we test the explanatory power of a schematicity continuum, one of the central assumptions within usage-based approaches, in regard to these contact effects. In doing so, we aim to better understand how schematicity influences language transfer as well as learn more about the cognitive mechanism of schematicity itself.Design:The empirical focus of this study is on native German speakers living in the Netherlands who tend to experience a lot of language transfer from their second language Dutch to their native language German. The experiment consists of a production task containing constructions that differ in regard to their potential level of schematicity (i.e., lexically specific, partially schematic, fully schematic) and in the type of transfer that they might trigger (i.e., covert and overt transfer).Data and analysis:We compare production data of native German speakers living in the Netherlands (N = 60) with those of a control group of speakers not in contact with Dutch (N = 60), to establish whether the language use of these two groups differs. In addition, we analyze both speaker and item variation for the different constructions.Findings/conclusions:The speakers with Dutch contact show a number of contact effects, such as covert and overt transfer as well as hypercorrection regarding the use of certain constructions.Originality:The variation analysis reveals individual differences in how speakers use the different constructions. Some of these differences can be attributed to their mental levels of schematicity.Significance/implications:The study shows that transfer depends on schematicity. In doing so, it provides direct evidence for different levels of schematicity in speakers’ mental representations, demonstrating the usefulness of studying cognitive mechanisms within a language contact setting. }

 abstract = {A comparison of the error profiles of monolingual (child L1) learners of Dutch, Moroccan children (child L2) and Moroccan adults (adult L2) learning Dutch as their L2 shows that participants in all groups massively overgeneralize [-neuter] articles to [+neuter] contexts. In all groups, the reverse gender mistake infrequently occurs. Gender expressed by Dutch attributive adjectives reveals an agerelated asymmetry between the three groups, however. Whereas participants in the child groups overgeneralize one particular suffix (namely the schwa), adult participants use both adjectival forms, the schwa-adjective and the bare adjective, incorrectly. It is argued that the asymmetry observed in adjectives reflects that adult learners exploit an input-based, lexical learning route, whereas children rely on grammar-based representations. The similarity in article selection between all groups follows from the assumption that adults, like children, make use of lexical frames. Crucially, lexical frames can successfully describe the distribution of gender-marked articles, but they cannot account for gender in adjectives.},

The authors argue that engagement in these literature-based theatrical activities promotes and expedites language entrenchment that usually develops gradually in ‘normal’ conversational contexts, which are usually lacking in cases of severe language endangerment. The paper addresses the theoretical and practical disparity regarding the role of literature in RLS activities (Fishman 1991), which emphasizes spoken language and ‘natural’ intergenerational language transmission. },

    abstract = {Researchers have only recently started to take advantage of the developments in technology and communication for sharing data and documents. However, the exchange of experimental material has not taken advantage of this progress yet. In order to facilitate access to experimental material, the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) project was created as a free standardized set of visual stimuli accessible to all researchers, through a normative database. The BOSS is currently the largest existing photo bank providing norms for more than 15 dimensions (e.g. familiarity, visual complexity, manipulability, etc.), making the BOSS an extremely useful research tool and a mean to homogenize scientific data worldwide. The first phase of the BOSS was completed in 2010, and contained 538 normative photos. The second phase of the BOSS project presented in this article, builds on the previous phase by adding 930 new normative photo stimuli. New categories of concepts were introduced, including animals, building infrastructures, body parts, and vehicles and the number of photos in other categories was increased. All new photos of the BOSS were normalized relative to their name, familiarity, visual complexity, object agreement, viewpoint agreement, and manipulability. The availability of these norms is a precious asset that should be considered for characterizing the stimuli as a function of the requirements of research and for controlling for potential confounding effects.},

En ambas comunidades se encuentran dispersas algunas familias de habla tepehua, llamadas "poblanas", y familias en las que se habla mexicanero y poblano o mexicanero y cora; en dichas familias la lengua cotidiana puede ser el español. También en algunas comunidades mestizadas se encuentran familias que usan el mexicanero como lengua de la casa. Todos los hablantes del mexicanero de la Sierra Madre Occidental manejan, en diversos grados de perfección, la lengua española.},

@ARTICLE{dakin2000,
  ABSTRACT = {The origin of the words \$lsquo;cacao\$rsquo; and \$lsquo;chocolate\$rsquo; and their use in the reconstruction of the early history of Mesoamerica, remain very controversial issues. Cambell and Kaufman (1976, American Antiquity 41:80–89), for example, proposed that the word \$lsquo;cacao\$rsquo; originated from Mixe–Zoque languages, thus possibly representing Olmec traditions. According to this argument, other Mesoamerican languages, including Nahuatl, borrowed the word as a symbol of prestige and Olmec influence. Other researchers claim the word \$lsquo;chocolate\$rsquo; represents a more recent neologism, a possible Maya–Nahuatl hybrid, due to the late appearance of the word in central Mexico's Colonial sources. We refute the putative Mixe–Zoque origin of \$lsquo;cacao\$rsquo; and provide linguistic evidence to propose that \$lsquo;cacao,\$rsquo; like \$lsquo;chocolate,\$rsquo; is a Uto-Aztecan term. Analysis of these words highlights general and particular evolutionary trends that originate from the Uto-Aztecan language family. In addition, we show that these two words were initially used as descriptive terms to refer to the shape of the plant's bean and the techniques of drink preparation. Etymological evidence verifies the use of a Mayan term for cacao as early as the Classic period (fourth century a.d.). This early appearance of the term in Mayan and the later diffusion of the Nahua word throughout all of Mesoamerica correlate with additional data to support the conclusion that Teotihuacanos spoke Nahuatl.},

At the same time, various hierarchies illustrate that some things are indeed more likely to be borrowed than others. &lt;i&gt;Linguistic Borrowing in Bilingual Contexts&lt;/i&gt; addresses both, by examining claims of no absolute limits and synthesizing various hierarchies.  It observes that all contact phenomena are systematic, and borrowing is no exception. Regarding forms, the determining factors lie in the nature of the morphological systems in contact and how they relate to one another. Two principles are proposed to determine the nature of the systematicity and interaction: the Principle of System Compatibility (PSC), and its corollary, the Principle of System Incompatibility (PSI). Together, these principles provide a consistent  account of the possibilities and limits to borrowing.",

	abstract = {Linked to a series of sociolinguistic differentials (e.g. power, cultural, conversational) materialized in specific linguistic phenomena, this paper analyzes a couple of discourse markers in Nahuatl linguistics; namely, the presence/absence of epenthetic /i/, its metathesis, and the marked use of pronominal prefixes. All these resources indexicalize different discourse genres and types of interaction together with different social positions in ritual and conversational discourse. Epenthetic /i/ has mostly been described as an obligatory segment to maintain the structure of the Nahuatl syllable, which according to existent grammatical descriptions does not allow consonant clusters. Yet as documented by this and few other works this restriction only holds for written discourse. As an overall trend, in actual oral practice the presence or absence of epenthetic /i/ manifests two different types of discourse, ranging from a highly formal (i.e. ritual) to an informal (i.e. extemporaneous) discourse. Metathesis of epenthetic /i/ is also interpreted by speakers as a marked choice towards a Nahuatl de iksaan, 'ancient Nahuatl', especially with the imperative, xi-/ ix-, whereas its deletion is conceived as the unmarked choice indexing more conversational, informal (referential or not) practices. Regarding pronouns, the shiftbetween the first person singular bound morphemes ni- to the second person singular ti-, while addressing a second person singular, mits-, which from an external point of view could be thought as ungrammatical, also indexes different interactional treatments and power differentials, such as those concomitant to generational and gender differences and different types of discourse and interaction. All this is succinctly analyzed in this paper for the first time, theoretically advancing an interpretation that goes beyond quantitative paradigms in sociolinguistics, postulating more than, for example, an audience oriented (Bell 1984) conversational and power approaches to the variable use of language, particularly in the case of Nahuatl.

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the distributions of word classes in English speeches made in the European Parliament and their German (written) translations and simultaneous interpretations. For comparison, a sample of original German speeches and a selection of political interviews are used. The study is motivated by the intention to understand the relationship between the type of mediation and communicative modes: mediated spoken language is compared to unmediated spoken language and to mediated written language. The results show that the interpretations exhibit a less nominal style than the translations, in this respect resembling unplanned spoken conversation. Other quantitative findings, such as a high frequency of adverbs, also point to a register effect, but interpretations have a hybrid status and can be located somewhere in the middle, between the register of the source text (parliamentary speech) and unplanned spoken discourse. The results are discussed against the background of the mechanisms that presumably underlie the choices made by translators (processing, register and strategies).},

    abstract = {This paper presents a phenomenon of colloquial English that we call Contrastive Reduplication (CR), involving the copying of words and sometimes phrases as in It's tuna salad, not SALAD-salad, or Do you LIKE-HIM-like him? Drawing on a corpus of examples gathered from natural speech, written texts, and television scripts, we show that CR restricts the interpretation of the copied element to a 'real' or prototypical reading. Turning to the structural properties of the construction, we show that CR is unusual among reduplication phenomena in that whole idioms can be copied, object pronouns are often copied (as in the second example above), and inflectional morphology need not be copied. Thus the 'scope' of CR cannot be defined in purely phonological terms; rather, a combination of phonological, morphosyntactic, syntactic, and lexical factors is involved. We develop an analysis within the parallel architecture framework of Jackendoff (1997, 2002), whereby CR is treated as a lexical item with syntactic and semantic content and reduplicative phonology. We then sketch an alternative analysis, based on current assumptions within the Minimalist Program, which involves movement into a focus-like position with both the head and the tail of the resulting chain spelled out.},

This article describes the situation within one particular subcommunity of the town: the congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Here the Nahuatl language has experienced a revival within the last five years, to a degree where congregational meetings are now held mostly in Nahuatl, and where young Witnesses are probably the only group of youths in Hueyapan to communicate daily in Nahuatl. It is argued that this situation arose as a result of the combination of the general sociolinguistic background in Hueyapan and the specific value system and social dynamics that exist in the community of Jehovah's Witnesses.},

@ARTICLE{hansen2012,
  ABSTRACT = {This article presents data showing that the syntax of the Nahuatl dialect spoken in Hueyapan, Morelos, Mexico has traits of nonconfigurationality: free word order and free pro-drop, with predicate-initial word order being pragmatically neutral. It permits discontinuous noun phrases and has no naturally occurring true quantifiers, suggesting that noun phrases in Hueyapan Nahuatl are adjuncts rather than actual arguments. These findings are contrasted with those of an earlier study by Jeffrey MacSwan, who concludes that Nahuatl syntax has relatively fixed subject-verb-object word order. It is suggested that the differences observed between the two Nahuatl varieties may be a result of methodological problems in MacSwan's collection of data, skewing it in the direction of a more rigid syntax.},

We review studies investigating cognate and homograph processing in visual word perception and word production, auditory word perception using the visual world paradigm, and cross-language priming, focusing specifically on how differences in proficiency modulate co-activation during lexical access. We further discuss differences in L2 proficiency in relation to immersion and age of L2 acquisition, how differences in L2 proficiency relate to neurocognitive aspects of cognitive control, and how changes in L2 proficiency relative to L1 proficiency may affect lexical processing.},

  ABSTRACT = {Authorities on the origin and history of Uto-Aztecan have held that speakers of the protolanguage were foragers who lived in upland regions of Arizona, New Mexico, and the adjacent areas of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua about 5,000 years ago. New lexical evidence supports a different view, that speakers of the protolanguage were maize cultivators. The Proto-Uto-Aztecan speech community was probably located in Mesoamerica and spread northward into the present range because of demographic pressure associated with cultivation. The chronology for the spread and differentiation of the family should then correspond to the chronology for the northward spread of maize cultivation from Mesoamerica into the U.S. Southwest, between 4500 and 3000 B.P.},

This exploratory paper takes a data-driven approach to assessing the use of academic vocabulary in Wikipedia articles. Our analysis is based on Coxhead’s Academic Word List, and the data comes from the Westbury Lab Wikipedia Corpus. We employ methods of statistical data analysis to classify Wikipedia articles according to the frequencies of academic words, and apply the same procedure to a comparable set of texts representing another genre, published research articles. The unsupervised classification procedure groups the articles according to academic content regardless of topic, which allows us to measure genre-specific similarities. The findings of the study show that academic words are common in both genres in focus, and more interestingly, if we look at aggregate frequencies of academic words, Wikipedia articles are not markedly different from RAs within the same discipline. This being said, we can observe disciplinary differences in the distribution of academic words in Wikipedia, such that Economics writing contains more academic words than the other two disciplines in focus. Disciplinary differences can likewise be observed in the distribution of individual academic words. },

Twenty advanced to near-native adult first language (L1) English speakers of L2 German and 20 native controls were tested in a study comprising two experiments. In elicited production, we probe accuracy in lexical gender assignment. In a visual-world eye tracking task, we test the predictive processing of syntactic gender agreement between determiners and nouns. The findings show clear contingencies (1) between overall accuracy in lexical gender assignment in production and target predictive processing of syntactic gender agreement in comprehension and (2) between the speed of lexical access and predictive syntactic gender agreement. These findings support lexical and computational accounts of L2 inflectional variability and argue against models positing representational deficits in morphosyntax in late L2 acquisition and processing.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present diachronic changes in terms of the conditions of first language acquisition.
Grammars, seen as mental organs, may change between two generations.  A change is initiated when (a population of) learners converge on a grammatical system which differs in at least one parameter value from the system internalized by the speakers of the previous generation.  Learnability issues then connect to both language acquisition and language change, and understanding language changes depends on understanding how children acquire their native language.  Acquisition is a process in which Universal Grammar (UG) interacts with a context-specific set of Primary Linguistic Data (PLD: the linguistic input to the child-learner) and uses these PLD as the source for triggers or cues that map the innate (preexperience) knowledge to a mature grammar.
If a certain phenomenon has survived through many generations, it must have been reflected clearly in the PLD.  Then, if we note that it has changed, something in the language performance of the previous generation must have changed, and thereby paved the way for a new interpretation.  Innovation leading to linguistic variation in the PLD and gradual changes in PLD play a central role in the explanation here: the immediate cause of a grammar change must lie in some alternation in the PLD.  We will look at how the language spoken in a certain community (E-language) may gradually become different from the language that originally served as the triggering experience.  These changes in the E-language also mean changes in the input available to the child-learners of the next generation and a motivation for a different parameter setting has arisen.},

En mettant en évidence certains phénomènes mal reconnus par la tradition grammaticale, l'auteur en montre l'importance typologique et théorique, et en particulier sur deux points. D'abord, la notion de relation prédicative semble plus apte que toute autre (et en particulier, que toute représentation bipartite) à traiter les phénomènes de hiérarchisation des arguments qui jouent un rôle morphosyntaxique capital. Ensuite, on doit poser comme base de toute la grammaire la notion de prédicativité, propriété qui s'applique à l'ensemble des items lexicaux (avec ses trois classes de verbes, noms et locatifs), de sorte que la construction des syntagmes nominaux (et d'une manière générale de tous les syntagmes) doit être décrite en termes d'opérations sur des schémas fondamentalement prédicatifs. A comprehensive linguistic study of classical nahuatl, the literary Aztec language of the 16th and 17th centuries, from a corpus including the Florentine codex and several other texts. The morphological and syntactic data reveal an underlying system of grammatical categories and semantico-syntactic operations which is of major interest both to typology and to a general theory of language. Two points are particularly important. The first is that the notion of predicative relation seems much more appropriate than any other (in particular, any kind of bipartition) to account for the hierarchy of arguments, which plays a prominent role in nahuatl morphosyntax. The second is that predicativity, a property shared by all lexical items (whose 3 classes are verbs, nouns and locatives) must be viewed as the center of the grammar, so that the construction of noun phrases (and more generally of all phrases) should be described in terms of operations applied to basically predicative patterns.},

  ABSTRACT = {The discovery of words in a Nahua language on a Maya ceramic vessel provides evidence of Nahua influence in the Maya region as early as a.d. 480, centuries earlier than previously believed. The words are spelled in syllabic Maya signs painted on a pot known to have contained chocolate (Hall et al. 1990). The words occur within the context of the primary standard sequence, a well-known Maya formula, and describe the chocolate drink that among the later Mexica (Aztec) was reserved for “rulers and esteemed noblewomen.” This new reading supports the Uto-Aztecan etymology of cacao proposed by Karin Dakin and Søren Wichmann (2000) and their assertion that an economically and militarily powerful Nahua-speaking people were responsible for the spread of the word cacao into southern Mesoamerica. More broadly, these findings have implications for the role of Uto-Aztecan speakers in the formation and spread of Mesoamerican civilization.},

    abstract={El libro Recolinización en Bolivia. Neonacionalismo extractivista y resistencia comunitaria es fruto de un encuentro de dos personas y sus respectivas miradas, unidas por un horizonte común que tras un intenso proceso de debate lograron complementarse y fundirse en un texto único que expresa integramente el senti-pensar de ambos. Escrito entre México y Bolivia, y también entre múltiples geografías, en las que a los autores les tocó coincidir en el tiempo-espacio creativo: apuntado en el cuaderno de campo en la Amazonía boliviana, tecleado en cafeterías coyacanenses y paceñas, este libro nace desde el compromiso y, a decir zapatista, la "digna rabia", para para que a través de sus páginas camine la palabra de esperanza en un escenario desesperante, pero con un horizonte "otro" siempre posible, como un homenaje a todos y todas los que siguen resistiendo y re-existiendo en el TIPNIS y otros tantos territorios y espacios en Bolivia y Abya Yala, en esta lucha común contra el despojo el autoritarismo y la mercantilización de la vida. Nos planteamos indagar y problematizar el periodo actual en Bolivia, al que identificamos como un proceso de recolonización por parte del gobierno del MAS. Éste deriva de su carácter neonacionalista, en cuanto al relanzamiento del proyecto del Estado-nación, y extractivista si se trata del modelo económico que lo sustenta. Será uno de los casos más emblemáticos de los últimos años -la defensa de TIPNIS-, el que desarrollaremos con detalle, basándonos en los testimonios de los propios sujetos rebeldes, para dar cuenta de la naturaleza del proyecto gubernamental, la perversidad de sus acciones y el desquiciamiento de sus discursos, pero sobre todo, para hacer visible la lucha de las y los indígenas de este territorio en resistencia, con sus horizontes, logros y retos.},

@ARTICLE{marzo2005,
  ABSTRACT = {This paper is part of a larger, ongoing PhD-project carried out at the K.U.Leuven in Belgium. The project investigates the linguistic effect of intensive bilingualism on Italian as a subordinate language for two generations of Italian-Dutch bilinguals who reside in Limburg, the easternmost region of Flanders, Belgium. The study examines language contact phenomena (language variation and language change) and specific speech patterns and the main purpose is to determine whether different types of grammatical phenomena (morphological, syntactic and lexical) in the speech of bilinguals are affected by language contact in the same way. It also seeks to determine whether the identified changes can be explained on the basis of the processes that are recognized in the literature (Muysken 2001; SilvaCorvalán 1994; Van Coetsem 1995) as characteristic of language contact, namely simplification and transfer. Finally, the project verifies in which way these features correlate with social factors. Until now very few studies on ‘migrant Italian’ in Europe have been carried out up, and most of them have focused on language attrition of the first generation. As far as concerns the Italian language in Belgium, most of the studies on second generation Italians in Flanders concern language behaviour, as eg. language shift (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1991) or school problems of children of migrant workers (Jacqmain 1978a; 1978b; 1979). For the second and third generation Italians, which constitute the group we have opted for, the concept of language loss is composite. In fact, the language of these two generations is the result of a series of phenomena that characterize linguistic evolution in emigrant communities and that can be classified under the general denominator of language loss. A first process is the language attrition of the first generation Italians, due to migration and the social distance from the community of native speakers. Furthermore, a large number of first generation Italians did not speak standard Italian when they immigrated to Belgium, they all spoke their own regional variant. The language they developed by talking with other Italians coming from other regions of Italy was a sort of ‘lingua franca’, often called Italiano popolare (Berruto 1983; Lepschy 1983; 1989a; 1989b; 1989c), to which we will return later in this paper. It is this language that was then passed on to the next generations. The second process that determined the language of the next generations is language shift. Studies on language shift among Italians in Flanders showed that Italian is not used anymore, only in family contexts, i.e. in the presence of grandparents or other first generation Italians that most of the time do not speak Dutch (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1991). The informants who collaborated in my fieldwork (cfr. infra) firmly expressed that they would spontaneously start a conversation in Dutch, rather than in Italian. Although they continue to speak it and although they make efforts to maintain it, for instance by planning frequent holidays in Italy, watching news on Italian television channels and buying Italian journals or magazines, more and more second --and obviously third--generation Italians speak mainly Dutch in every day life, even if they live in a community with many Italians. Dutch has clearly become the dominant language and will continue to influence the language of future generations. As a direct consequence of the previous processes, the third process that defines the language of our target group is the so-called incomplete language acquisition (Jaspaert \&amp; Kroon 1986), due to the},

This book is an introduction to the subject, covering individual and societal multilingualism, the acquisition of two or more languages from birth, second language acquisition in adulthood, language change, linguistic typology, language processing and the structure of the language faculty. It explains the effects of multilingualism on society and language policy, as well as the consequences that long-term bilingualism within communities can have for the structure of languages. Drawing on the author's own first-hand observations of child and adult bilingualism, the book provides a clear analysis of such phenomena as language convergence, grammatical borrowing, and mixed languages.},

    abstract = {This article argues for an account of language shift that focuses on ideological conflicts and competing discourses of language, identity, and progress in Tlaxcala, Mexico. The study is based on ethnographic research on patterns of language use, ideology, and boundary differentiation in several Mexicano (Nahuatl)-speaking communities in the Malintzi region of Central Mexico. Metadiscursive practices consisting of three discourses that have local, regional, and national expressions are analyzed: the pro-development metadiscourse of salir adelante, 'forging ahead' and improving one's socio-economic position; the discourse of menosprecio, denigration of indigenous identity; and the pro-indígena or pro-indigenous discourse that promotes a positive attitude toward indigenous identity. Analysis of these discourses offers an understanding of the semiotic resources speakers employ as they orient toward and against particular identities that are both "traditional" and "modern," as they respond to changing social and economic circumstances. It is concluded that a focus on individuals and communities, through ethnography and discourse analysis, is of critical importance to understanding how and why speakers shift their ideologies and their languages.},

  ABSTRACT = {Languages are constantly changing. New words are added to the English language every year, either borrowed or coined, and there is often railing against the 'decline' of the language by public figures. Some languages, such as French and Finnish, have academies to protect them against foreign imports. Yet languages are species-like constructs, which evolve naturally over time. Migration, imperialism, and globalization have blurred boundaries between many of them, producing new ones (such as creoles) and driving some to extinction. This book examines the processes by which languages change, from.},

  ABSTRACT = {As linguists theorize about language endangerment and loss (LEL), we must understand the big picture: the coexistence of languages in particular polities and how the competition that sometimes arises is resolved. Many concerns have been voiced about LEL since the early 1990s, but theoretical developments regarding language vitality lag far behind linguists’ current investment in language advocacy. While discussing issues such as the failure to connect the subject matter to language evolution in general, the framing of LEL as deleterious almost exclusively to ‘indigenous peoples’, a lack of historical time depth, and the omission of the ecological factors in typical approaches to LEL, I argue that linguistics should theorize about language vitality more adequately than has been the case to date.},

Those published to date have largely been from the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Testaments of Toluca presents a large body of Nahuatl wills (98) from 1652 to 1783 from an important valley not much studied, thus greatly enlarging our perspective on the evolution of indigenous society and culture in central Mexico. Each testament is transcribed, translated, and accompanied by a commentary on the testator's situation and on interesting terminology. A substantial introductory study fully analyzes the testamentary genre as seen in this corpus (a first) and summarizes the content of the documents in realms such as gender, kinship, household, and land. Wills are very human documents, and the apparatus draws out this aspect, telling us much about indigenous life in central Mexico in the third century after Spanish contact. All this makes the book of potential interest to a broad spectrum of readers."--BOOK JACKET.  xv, 250 p. : ill. ; 29 cm. Nahuas -- History -- Sources.

  ABSTRACT = {The article argues that Nahuatl, the most widely spoken indigenous language in Mexico, is at risk of replacement by Spanish, the language of greater economic power, education, and social prestige. Both to promote Mexico's cultural and linguistic diversity and improve education for indigenous children, the Mexican Ministry of Education has proposed the implementation of bilingual maintenance programs. An analysis of the likelihood of the survival of Nahuatl, based in part on Fishman's (1991) model for language revitalization, and a critique of the new bilingual programs with respect to the role they may play in promoting the revitalization of Nahuatl are provided. It is concluded that current programs will assist in revitalizing Nahuatl if they obtain grassroots support in Nahuatl-speaking communities.},

	abstract = {This article examines honorific registers in Central Mexican and Guatemalan varieties of Nahuatl in seventeenth-century Guatemala, highlighting the importance of sociolinguistic methods for the dialectology of Mesoamerican languages. A comparative study of two pastoral texts reveals that the differences between the honorific registers of the Nahuatl varieties were quantitative rather than categorical: the structure of honorifics is the same (for all syntactic categories), but significant differences appear in the frequency of honorific marking, especially on verbs. Metalinguistic comments in Spanish sources provide evidence of the impact of these differences on stylistic marking, ethnic boundary work, and indexing of social status.},

    abstract={This volume outlines a model of language that can be characterized as functionalist, usage-based, dynamic, and complex-adaptive.

	abstract = {This article examines the practice of ordaining young men because of their personal language ability, a process referred to as an ordination a título de lengua. As a result of reforms codified by the Catholic Church in the Council of Trent, prospective priests were required to support themselves without assistance from the Church, a requirement called a title. This requirement was satisfied if an ordinand enjoyed a benefice or a chantry. Because of the need to have as many priests who knew native languages as possible, the crown ordered that the ability to speak a native language could be used in lieu of a title. Starting in the 1560s the bishops of Mexico began to keep track of clergy according to their ability to speak a native language. When the system of oposiciones (competitive placement exams) began in the 1580s, candidates for benefices would be tested on their language ability. This article traces the development of a bilingual secular clergy in order to evaluate whether royal officials responded to the widespread use of Nahuatl at the time of contact or whether those same officials encouraged the spread of Nahuatl through their policies.},

Here, we outline the Grambank database. With over 400,000 data points and 2400 languages, Grambank is the largest comparative grammatical database available. The comprehensiveness of Grambank allows us to quantify the relative effects of genealogical inheritance and geographic proximity on the structural diversity of the world’s languages, evaluate constraints on linguistic diversity, and identify the world’s most unusual languages. An analysis of the consequences of language loss reveals that the reduction in diversity will be strikingly uneven across the major linguistic regions of the world. Without sustained efforts to document and revitalize endangered languages, our linguistic window into human history, cognition, and culture will be seriously fragmented. Grambank reveals global patterns in linguistic diversity and highlights the impact of language loss.}}

  ABSTRACT = {Group vitality is a widely invoked construct in the study of minority language maintenance and interethnic relations. Per the original framework introduced 40 years ago, the more vitality an ethnolinguistic group perceives itself to have, the more likely that it will thrive as a collective entity in an intergroup context. Consequently, research adopting this paradigm—herein termed vitality theory—has studied ways in which objective and subjective group vitality has manifested itself in the endurance of ethnolinguistic groups. The notion of objective vitality includes the factors of demographics, institutional support, and status that characterize the strength of a group in comparison to others present in an intergroup setting. Contrastively, subjective vitality was introduced to highlight how groups may cognitively and affectively perceive these same factors. A large body of empirical research has been conducted within the vitality theory framework that has resulted in several stages of development. Evidence has shown that while the components of objective vitality (demographics, institutional support, status) do not typically manifest themselves as distinct components in the structure of subjective vitality, they do form a single component reflecting the perceived strength of the group. In addition, several other social psychological factors, such as perception of the legitimacy of intergroup relations, the level of ethnocentrism, and perception of intergroup distance, were incorporated into models of subjective vitality. Relatedly, these factors are shaped into group members’ discourse of vitality, which is a highly dialogical process of negotiation of subjective vitality of the groups engaged in intergroup contact. The vitality framework has been usefully invoked beyond ethnolinguistic groups, embracing several intergroup settings including age, gender, and sexual orientation. Vitality, which has provoked some controversy in the literature, has also been widely adopted by very different approaches as an umbrella term to denote the long-term sustainability of a group. Scholars in linguistics, sociology, psychology, education, anthropology, and beyond have contributed much to the concept, helping to educate and raise awareness as to why languages die out and the effects of such languages dying out.},

    abstract = { The concept of disease causation has changed twice, first from natural to social determining factors, and, second, from determination by social conditions to determination by stressful social relations. These changes roughly parallel the emergence of industrial capital and its change from a highly individualistic and competitive process to a “social” process. In this article, “epidemics” are treated as social events that occur amidst these changes in disease and the economic organization of society.Nineteenth-century epidemics occurred when business attempted to solve its economic problems by creating dramatic gaps between the social needs of an expanding labor force and available goods and services. The coincidence of periodic crises in production and in health ensured that “epidemics” would be occasions for labor to struggle against injustice, not simply sickness. And workers demonstrated a capacity for self-organization during epidemics that forced municipal authorities to reform fundamentally their organization of work, the market, and social service.After 1900, “reform” was a permanent part of capital's developmental strategy. The new “social” capitalist sought to organize work politically, far beyond the factory, and to extract “value” not from blue-collar workers alone but from all social activity.These developments reduced mortality due to infectious and childhood disease. But they also created the new epidemics of chronic stress. Despite the mystification of social etiology by medicine, the identity of the disease process with more general means of social reproduction indicates that illness is now “endopolic,” the product not of nature but of historically specific political and economic decisions and processes. }

Based on extensive, original sociological and anthropological data generated by PERLA, this landmark study analyzes ethnoracial classification, inequality, and discrimination, as well as public opinion about Afro-descended and indigenous social movements and policies that foster greater social inclusiveness, all set within an ethnoracial history of each country. A once-in-a-generation examination of contemporary ethnicity, this book promises to contribute in significant ways to policymaking and public opinion in Latin America.Edward Telles, PERLA's principal investigator, explains that profound historical and political forces, including multiculturalism, have helped to shape the formation of ethnic identities and the nature of social relations within and across nations. One ofPigmentocracies's many important conclusions is that unequal social and economic status is at least as much a function of skin color as of ethnoracial identification. Investigators also found high rates of discrimination by color and ethnicity widely reported by both targetsandwitnesses. Still, substantial support across countries was found for multicultural-affirmative policies--a notable result given that in much of modern Latin America race and ethnicity have been downplayed or ignored as key factors despite their importance for earlier nation-building.},

    abstract = "{We examine sources of indigenous identity in the two countries with the largest indigenous populations in the Western Hemisphere—Mexico and Peru. We find that the size of the indigenous population varies dramatically depending on the measure of indigeneity used, and that using multiple measures captures distinct modes of indigeneity. Using latent class analysis, we find that contemporary indigenous classification clusters around four types, which we characterize as Traditional Indians, Indigenous Mestizos, New Indians, and Non-Indigenous. Traditional Indians tend to be indigenous on virtually all indicators, and they are especially poor, dark, and rural. Indigenous Mestizos tend to speak an indigenous language, but self-identification as indigenous is tenuous. New Indians assert an indigenous identity despite their frequent lack of linguistic knowledge and close indigenous ancestry, and they are as urban, educated, and light-skinned as the Non-Indigenous. The analysis addresses sociological concepts of ethnic boundaries, assimilation, mestizaje, and symbolic ethnicity and discusses the implications of distinct modes of indigenous ethnicity.}",

  ABSTRACT = {Contributions from an international team of experts revisit and update the concept of linguistic ecology in order to critically examine current theoretical approaches to language contact. Language is understood as a part of complex socio-historical-cultural systems, and interaction between the different dimensions and levels of these systems is considered to be essential for specific language forms. This book presents a uniform, abstract model of linguistic ecology based on, among other things, two concepts of Edmund Husserl's philosophy (parts and wholes, and foundation). It considers the individual speaker in the specific communication situation to be the essential heuristic basis of linguistic analysis. The chapters present and employ a new, transparent and accessible contact linguistic vocabulary to aid reader comprehension, and explore a wide range of language contact situations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Asia and the Pacific. This book will be fascinating reading for students and researchers across contact linguistics and cultural studies.},
